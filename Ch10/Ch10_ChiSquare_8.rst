Summary
-------

The key ideas discussed in this chapter are:

-  :doc:`The χ² (chi-square) goodness-of-fit test <../Ch10/Ch10_ChiSquare_1>` is used
   when you have a table of observed frequencies of different categories, and
   the null hypothesis gives you a set of “known” probabilities to compare
   them to.

-  :doc:`The χ² (chi-square) test of independence <../Ch10/Ch10_ChiSquare_2>` is used
   when you have a contingency table (cross-tabulation) of two categorical
   variables. The null hypothesis is that there is no relationship or
   association between the variables.

-  :doc:`Effect size <../Ch10/Ch10_ChiSquare_4>` for a contingency table can be
   measured in several ways. In particular we noted the Cramér’s *V* statistic.

-  Both versions of the Pearson test rely on two :doc:`assumptions
   <../Ch10/Ch10_ChiSquare_5>`: that the expected frequencies are sufficiently large,
   and that the observations are independent. The :doc:`Fisher exact test
   <../Ch10/Ch10_ChiSquare_6>` can be used when the expected frequencies are small. The
   :doc:`McNemar test <../Ch10/Ch10_ChiSquare_7>` can be used for some kinds of
   violations of independence.

If you’re interested in learning more about categorical data analysis a
good first choice would be `Agresti (2018) <References.html#agresti-2018>`__
which, as the title suggests, provides an *Introduction to Categorical Data
Analysis*. If the introductory book isn’t enough for you (or can’t solve
the problem you’re working on) you could consider `Agresti (2012)
<References.html#agresti-2012>`__, *Categorical Data Analysis*. The
latter is a more advanced text, so it’s probably not wise to jump
straight from this book to that one.
