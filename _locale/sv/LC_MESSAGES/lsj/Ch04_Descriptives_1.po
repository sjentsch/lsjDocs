"you’d like to know something about where the “average” or “middle” of "

"If your data are nominal scale you probably shouldn’t be using either the"

"Let’s expand on that last part a little. One consequence is that there "
"are systematic differences between the mean and the median when the "
"histogram is asymmetric (skewed; see `Skew and kurtosis "
"<Ch04_Descriptives_3.html#skew-and-kurtosis>`__). This is illustrated in "
":numref:`fig-meanmedian`. Notice that the median (right hand side) is "
"located closer to the “body” of the histogram, whereas the mean (left "
"hand side) gets dragged towards the “tail” (where the extreme values "
"are). To give a concrete example, suppose Bob (income $50,000), Kate "
"(income $60,000) and Jane (income $65,000) are sitting at a table. The "
"average income at the table is $58,333 and the median income is $60,000. "
"Then Bill sits down with them (income $100,000,000). The average income "
"has now jumped to $25,043,750 but the median rises only to $62,500. If "
"you’re interested in looking at the overall income at the table the mean "
