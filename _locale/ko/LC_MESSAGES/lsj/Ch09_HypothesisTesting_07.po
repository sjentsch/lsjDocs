"At this point some of you might be wondering if this is a “real” "
"hypothesis test, or just a toy example that I made up. It’s real. In the "
"previous discussion I built the test from first principles, thinking that"
" it was the simplest possible problem that you might ever encounter in "
"real life. However, this test already exists. It’s called the *binomial "
"test*, and it’s implemented by jamovi as one of the statistical analyses "
"available when you hit the ‘Frequencies’ button. To test the null "
"hypothesis that the response probability is one-half ``p = 0.5``,\\ [#]_ "
"and using data in which ``x = 62`` of ``n = 100`` people made the correct"
" response, available in the ``binomialtest.omv`` data file, we get the "
"results shown in :numref:`fig-binomialtest`."

"Right now, this output looks pretty unfamiliar to you, but you can see "
"that it’s telling you more or less the right things. Specifically, the "
"*p*-value of 0.02 is less than the usual choice of *α* = 0.05, so you can"
" reject the null. We’ll talk a lot more about how to read this sort of "
"output as we go along, and after a while you’ll hopefully find it quite "
"easy to read and understand."

"Note that the ``p`` here has nothing to do with a *p* value. The ``p`` "
"argument in the jamovi binomial test corresponds to the probability of "
"making a correct response, according to the null hypothesis. In other "
"words, it’s the *θ* value."
