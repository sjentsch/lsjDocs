"Another form of graph that you often want to plot is the **bar graph**. "
"Let’s use the ``afl.finalists`` data set with the ``afl.finalists`` "
"variable that I introduced in `Mode <Ch04_Descriptives_1.html#mode>`__. "
"What I want to do is draw a bar graph that displays the number of finals "
"that each team has played in over the time spanned by the "
"``afl.finalists`` data set. There are lots of teams, but I am "
"particularly interested in just four: Brisbane, Carlton, Fremantle and "
"Richmond. So the first step is to set up a filter so just those four "
"teams are included in the bar graph. This is straightforward in jamovi "
"and you can do it by using the ``Filters`` function that we used "
"previously. Open up the ``Filters`` screen and type in the following:"

"When you have done this you will see, in the ``Data`` view, that jamovi "
"has filtered out all values apart from those we have specified. Next, "
"open up the ``Exploration`` → ``Descriptives`` window and click on the "
"``Bar plot`` check box (remember to move the ``afl.finalists`` variable "
"across into the ``Variables`` box so that jamovi knows which variable to "
"use). You should then get a bar graph, something like that shown in "
":numref:`fig-bar1`."

"Hold on, you might be thinking. What’s the good of being able to draw "
"pretty pictures in jamovi if I can’t save them and send them to friends "
"to brag about how awesome my data is? How do I save the picture? Simples."
" Just right click on the plot image and save it to a file, either as "
"``eps`, ``svg`` or ``pdf``. These formats all produce nice images that "
"you can the send to your friends, or include in your assignments or "
"papers."
