"It feels somewhat strange to be writing this chapter, and more than a "
"little inappropriate. An epilogue is what you write when a book is "
"finished, and this book really isn’t finished. There are a lot of things "
"still missing from this book. It doesn’t have an index yet. A lot of "
"references are missing. There are no “do it yourself” exercises. And in "
"general, I feel that there a lot of things that are wrong with the "
"presentation, organisation and content of this book. Given all that, I "
"don’t want to try to write a “proper” epilogue. I haven’t finished "
"writing the substantive content yet, so it doesn’t make sense to try to "
"bring it all together. But this version of the book is going to go online"
" for students to use, and you will may be to purchase a hard copy too, so"
" I want to give it at least a veneer of closure. So let’s give it a go, "
"shall we?"

"First, I’m going to talk a bit about some of the content that I wish I’d "
"had the chance to cram into this version of the book, just so that you "
"can get a sense of what other ideas are out there in the world of "
"statistics. I think this would be important even if this book were "
"getting close to a final product. One thing that students often fail to "
"realise is that their introductory statistics classes are just that, an "
"introduction. If you want to go out into the wider world and do real data"
" analysis, you have to learn a whole lot of new tools that extend the "
"content of your undergraduate lectures in all sorts of different ways. "
"Don’t assume that something can’t be done just because it wasn’t covered "
"in undergrad. Don’t assume that something is the right thing to do just "
"because it *was* covered in an undergrad class. To stop you from falling "
"victim to that trap, I think it’s useful to give a bit of an overview of "
"some of the other ideas out there."
