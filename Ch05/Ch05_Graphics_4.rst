Saving image files using jamovi
-------------------------------

Hold on, you might be thinking. What is the good of being able to draw pretty
pictures in jamovi if I can not save them and send them to friends to brag about
how awesome my data is? How do I save the picture? Simples. Just right click on
the plot image and export it to a file, either as ``png``, ``eps``, ``svg`` or
``pdf``. These formats all produce nice images that you can the send to your
friends, or include in your assignments or manuscripts. Whereas ``png`` and 
``pdf`` files are especially suited to share them with others (a lot of
different software packages read them), are ``eps`` and ``svg`` files very
suited to be edited (e.g., with `Inkscape <https://inkscape.org/>`__).
