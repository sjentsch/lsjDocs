"What should you do if your cell counts are too small, but you’d still "
"like to test the null hypothesis that the two variables are independent? "
"One answer would be “collect more data”, but that’s far too glib There "
"are a lot of situations in which it would be either infeasible or "
"unethical do that. If so, statisticians have a kind of moral obligation "
"to provide scientists with better tests. In this instance, `Fisher "
"(1922a) <References.html#fisher-1922a>`__ kindly provided the right "
"answer to the question. To illustrate the basic idea let’s suppose that "
"we’re analysing data from a field experiment looking at the emotional "
"status of people who have been accused of Witchcraft, some of whom are "
"currently being burned at the stake.\\ [#]_ Unfortunately for the "
"scientist (but rather fortunately for the general populace), it’s "
"actually quite hard to find people in the process of being set on fire, "
"so the cell counts are awfully small in some cases. A contingency table "
"of the ``salem.csv`` data illustrates the point:"

"Looking at this data, you’d be hard pressed not to suspect that people "
"not on fire are more likely to be happy than people on fire. However, the"
" χ²-test makes this very hard to test because of the small sample size. "
"So, speaking as someone who doesn’t want to be set on fire, I’d *really* "
"like to be able to get a better answer than this. This is where "
"**Fisher’s exact test** (`Fisher, 1922a <References.html#fisher-"
"1922a>`__\\ ) comes in very handy."

"The Fisher exact test works somewhat differently to the χ²-test (or in "
"fact any of the other hypothesis tests that I talk about in this book) "
"insofar as it doesn’t have a test statistic, but it calculates the "
"*p*-value “directly”. I’ll explain the basics of how the test works for a"
" 2 · 2 contingency table. As before, let’s have some notation:"

"and as you might imagine, it’s a slightly tricky exercise to figure out "
"what this probability is. But it turns out that this probability is "
"described by a distribution known as the *hypergeometric distribution*. "
"What we have to do to calculate our *p*-value is calculate the "
"probability of observing this particular table *or a table that is “more "
"extreme”*.\\ [#]_ Back in the 1920s, computing this sum was daunting even"
" in the simplest of situations, but these days it’s pretty easy as long "
"as the tables aren’t too big and the sample size isn’t too large. The "
"conceptually tricky issue is to figure out what it means to say that one "
"contingency table is more “extreme” than another. The easiest solution is"
" to say that the table with the lowest probability is the most extreme. "
"This then gives us the *p*-value."
