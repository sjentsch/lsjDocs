"Remarkably, most departments had a *higher* rate of admissions for "

"Here’s what’s going on. Firstly, notice that the departments are *not* "
"equal to one another in terms of their admission percentages: some "
"departments (e.g., A, B) tended to admit a high percentage of the "
"qualified applicants, whereas others (e.g., F) tended to reject most of "
"the candidates, even if they were high quality. So, among the six "
"departments shown above, notice that department A is the most generous, "
"followed by B, C, D, E and F in that order. Next, notice that males and "
"females tended to apply to different departments. If we rank the "
"departments in terms of the total number of male applicants, we get **A**"
" > **B** > D > C > F > E (the “easy” departments are in bold). On the "
"whole, males tended to apply to the departments that had high admission "
"rates. Now compare this to how the female applicants distributed "
"themselves. Ranking the departments in terms of the total number of "
"female applicants produces a quite different ordering C > E > D > F > "
"**A** > **B**. In other words, what these data seem to be suggesting is "
"that the female applicants tended to apply to “harder” departments. And "
"in fact, if we look at :numref:`fig-berkeley` we see that this trend is "
"systematic, and quite striking. This effect is known as **Simpson’s "
"paradox**. It’s not common, but it does happen in real life, and most "
"people are very surprised by it when they first encounter it, and many "
"people refuse to even believe that it’s real. It is very real. And while "
"there are lots of very subtle statistical lessons buried in there, I want"
" to use it to make a much more important point: doing research is hard, "
"and there are *lots* of subtle, counter-intuitive traps lying in wait for"
" the unwary. That’s reason #2 why scientists love statistics, and why we "
"teach research methods. Because science is hard, and the truth is "
"sometimes cunningly hidden in the nooks and crannies of complicated data."

"The Berkeley 1973 college admissions data. This figure plots the "
"admission rate for the 85 departments that had at least one female "
"applicant, as a function of the percentage of applicants that were "
"female. The plot is a redrawing of Figure 1 from `Bickel et al. (1975) "
"<References.html#bickel-1975>`__. Circles plot departments with more than"
" 40 applicants; the area of the circle is proportional to the total "
"number of applicants. The crosses plot departments with fewer than 40 "

"Before leaving this topic entirely, I want to point out something else "
"really critical that is often overlooked in a research methods class. "
"Statistics only solves *part* of the problem. Remember that we started "
"all this with the concern that Berkeley’s admissions processes might be "
"unfairly biased against female applicants. When we looked at the "
"“aggregated” data, it did seem like the university was discriminating "
"against women, but when we “disaggregate” and looked at the individual "
"behaviour of all the departments, it turned out that the actual "
"departments were, if anything, slightly biased in favour of women. The "
"gender bias in total admissions was caused by the fact that women tended "
"to self-select for harder departments. From a legal perspective, that "
"would probably put the university in the clear. Postgraduate admissions "
"are determined at the level of the individual department, and there are "
"good reasons to do that. At the level of individual departments the "
"decisions are more or less unbiased (the weak bias in favour of females "
"at that level is small, and not consistent across departments). Since the"
" university can’t dictate which departments people choose to apply to, "
"and the decision making takes place at the level of the department it can"
" hardly be held accountable for any biases that those choices produce."

"That was the basis for my somewhat glib remarks earlier, but that’s not "
"exactly the whole story, is it? After all, if we’re interested in this "
"from a more sociological and psychological perspective, we might want to "
"ask *why* there are such strong gender differences in applications. Why "
"do males tend to apply to engineering more often than females, and why is"
" this reversed for the English department? And why is it the case that "
"the departments that tend to have a female-application bias tend to have "
"lower overall admission rates than those departments that have a male-"
"application bias? Might this not still reflect a gender bias, even though"
" every single department is itself unbiased? It might. Suppose, "
"hypothetically, that males preferred to apply to “hard sciences” and "
"females prefer “humanities”. And suppose further that the reason for why "
"the humanities departments have low admission rates is because the "
"government doesn’t want to fund the humanities (Ph.D. places, for "
"instance, are often tied to government funded research projects). Does "
"that constitute a gender bias? Or just an unenlightened view of the value"
" of the humanities? What if someone at a high level in the government cut"
" the humanities funds because they felt that the humanities are “useless "
"chick stuff”. That seems pretty *blatantly* gender biased. None of this "
"falls within the purview of statistics, but it matters to the research "
"project. If you’re interested in the overall structural effects of subtle"
" gender biases, then you probably want to look at *both* the aggregated "
"and disaggregated data. If you’re interested in the decision making "
"process at Berkeley itself then you’re probably only interested in the "
"disaggregated data."

"In short there are a lot of critical questions that you can’t answer with"
" statistics, but the answers to those questions will have a huge impact "
"on how you analyse and interpret data. And this is the reason why you "
"should always think of statistics as a *tool* to help you learn about "
"your data. No more and no less. It’s a powerful tool to that end, but "
"there’s no substitute for careful thought."
