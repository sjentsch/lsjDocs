"Okay, enough with the sales pitch. Let’s get started. Just as with any "
"piece of software, jamovi needs to be installed on a “computer”, which is"
" a magical box that does cool things and delivers free ponies. Or "
"something along those lines; I may be confusing computers with the iPad "
"marketing campaigns. Anyway, jamovi is freely distributed online and you "
"can download it from the jamovi homepage, which is:"

"One way or another, regardless of what operating system you’re using, "
"it’s time to open jamovi and get started. When first starting jamovi you "
"will be presented with a user interface which looks something like "

"To the left is the spreadsheet view, and to the right is where the "

"It is possible to simply begin typing values into the jamovi spreadsheet "
"as you would in any other spreadsheet software. Alternatively, existing "
"data sets in the CSV (.csv) file format can be opened in jamovi. "
"Additionally, you can easily import Excel, LibreOffice, SPSS, SAS, Stata "
"and JASP files directly into jamovi. To open a file select the File tab "
"(three horizontal lines; top left hand corner), select ``Open`` and then "
"choose from the files listed on ``Browse`` depending on whether you want "
"to open an example or a file stored on your computer."

"Analyses can be selected from the analysis ribbon or menu along the top. "

"When you have the analysis set up correctly you can dismiss the analysis "

"Although jamovi is updated frequently it doesn’t usually make much of a "
