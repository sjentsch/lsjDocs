"As with one-way ANOVA, the key assumptions of factorial ANOVA are "
"homogeneity of variance (all groups have the same standard deviation), "
"normality of the residuals, and independence of the observations. The "
"first two are things we can check for. The third is something that you "
"need to assess yourself by asking if there are any special relationships "
"between different observations, for example repeated measures where the "
"independent variable is time so there is a relationship between the "
"observations at time one and time two: observations at different time "
"points are from the *same* people. Additionally, if you aren’t using a "
"saturated model (e.g., if you’ve omitted the interaction terms) then "
"you’re also assuming that the omitted terms aren’t important. Of course, "
"you can check this last one by running an ANOVA with the omitted terms "
"included and see if they’re significant, so that’s pretty easy. What "
"about homogeneity of variance and normality of the residuals? As it turns"
" out, these are pretty easy to check. It’s no different to the checks we "
"did for a one-way ANOVA."

"As mentioned in Section `Checking the homogeneity of variance assumption "
"<Ch13_ANOVA_06.html#checking-the-homogeneity-of-variance-assumption>`__, "
"it’s a good idea to visually inspect a plot of the standard deviations "
"compared across different groups / categories, and also see if the Levene"
" test is consistent with the visual inspection. The theory behind the "
"Levene test was discussed in that section, so I won’t discuss it again. "
"This test expects that you have a saturated model (i.e., including all of"
" the relevant terms), because the test is primarily concerned with the "
"within-group variance, and it doesn’t really make a lot of sense to "
"calculate this any way other than with respect to the full model. The "
"Levene test can be specified under the ANOVA ``Assumption Checks`` → "
"``Homogeneity Tests`` option in jamovi, with the result shown as in "
":numref:`fig-factorialanova5`. The fact that the Levene test is non-"
"significant means that, providing it is consistent with a visual "
"inspection of the plot of standard deviations, we can safely assume that "
"the homogeneity of variance assumption is not violated."

"As with one-way ANOVA we can test for the normality of residuals in a "
"straightforward fashion (see `Checking the normality assumption "
"<Ch13_ANOVA_06.html#checking-the-normality-assumption>`__). Primarily "
"though, it’s generally a good idea to examine the residuals graphically "
"using a QQ-plot. See :numref:`fig-factorialanova5`."
