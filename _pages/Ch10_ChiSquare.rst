Categorical data analysis
=========================

Now that we’ve covered the basic theory behind hypothesis testing it’s time to
start looking at specific tests that are commonly used in psychology. So where
should we start? Not every textbook agrees on where to start, but I’m going to
start with “χ² tests” (this chapter, pronounced “chi-square” [#]_) and
“*t*-tests” (Chapter `Comparing two means
<Ch11_tTest.html#comparing-two-means>`__). Both of these tools are very
frequently used in scientific practice, and whilst they’re not as powerful as
“regression” (see Chapter `Correlation and linear regression
<Ch12_Regression.html#correlation-and-linear-regression>`__) and “Analysis of
Variance” (Chapter `Comparing several means (one-way ANOVA)
<Ch13_ANOVA.html#comparing-several-means-one-way-anova>`__) they’re much easier
to understand.

The term “categorical data” is just another name for “nominal scale data”. It’s
nothing that we haven’t already discussed, it’s just that in the context of
data analysis people tend to use the term “categorical data” rather than
“nominal scale data”. I don’t know why. In any case, **categorical data
analysis** refers to a collection of tools that you can use when your data are
nominal scale. However, there are a lot of different tools that can be used for
categorical data analysis, and this chapter covers only a few of the more
common ones.
