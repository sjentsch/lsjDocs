Estimating unknown quantities from a sample
===========================================

At the start of the last chapter I highlighted the critical distinction between
*descriptive statistics* and *inferential statistics*. As discussed in
`Descriptive statistics <Ch04_Descriptives.html#descriptive-statistics>`__,
the role of descriptive statistics is to concisely summarise what we *do* know.
In contrast, the purpose of inferential statistics is to “learn what we do not
know from what we do”. Now that we have a foundation in probability theory we
are in a good position to think about the problem of statistical inference.
What kinds of things would we like to learn about? And how do we learn them?
These are the questions that lie at the heart of inferential statistics, and
they are traditionally divided into two “big ideas”: estimation and hypothesis
testing. The goal in this chapter is to introduce the first of these big ideas,
estimation theory, but I’m going to witter on about sampling theory first
because estimation theory doesn’t make sense until you understand sampling. As
a consequence, this chapter divides naturally into two parts
`Samples, populations and sampling
<Ch08_Estimation_1.html#samples-populations-and-sampling>`__ through
`Sampling distributions and the central limit theorem 
<Ch08_Estimation_3.html#sampling-distributions-and-the-central-limit-theorem>`__
are focused on sampling theory, and `Estimating means and standard deviations 
<Ch08_Estimation_4.html#estimating-population-parameters>`__ and `Estimating a
confidence interval <Ch08_Estimation_5.html#estimating-a-confidence-interval>`__
make use of sampling theory to discuss how statisticians think about estimation.
