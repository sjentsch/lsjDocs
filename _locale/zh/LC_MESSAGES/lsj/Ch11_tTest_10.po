"A `paired samples t-test <Ch11_tTest_05.html#the-paired-"
"samples-t-test>`__ is used when you have two scores from each person, and"
" you want to test the null hypothesis that the two scores have the same "
"mean. It is equivalent to taking the difference between the two scores "
"for each person, and then running a one sample *t*-test on the difference"
" scores."
