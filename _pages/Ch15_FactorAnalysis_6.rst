Summary
-------

In this chapter on factor analysis and related techniques we have
introduced and demonstrated statistical analyses that assess the pattern
of relationships in a data set. Specifically, we have covered:

-  `Exploratory Factor Analysis
   <Ch15_FactorAnalysis_1.html#exploratory-factor-analysis>`__  (EFA).
   EFA is a statistical technique for identifying underlying latent factors
   in a data set. Each observed variable is conceptualised as representing
   the latent factor to some extent, indicated by a factor loading.
   Researchers also use EFA as a way of data reduction, i.e. identifying
   observed variables than can be combined into new factor variables for
   subsequent analysis.

-  `Principal Component Analysis
   <Ch15_FactorAnalysis_2.html#principal-component-analysis>`__ (PCA) is a
   data reduction technique which, strictly speaking, does not identify
   underlying latent factors. Instead, PCA simply produces a linear combination
   of observed variables.

-  `Confirmatory Factor Analysis
   <Ch15_FactorAnalysis_3.html#confirmatory-factor-analysis>`__ (CFA). Unlike
   EFA, with CFA you start with an idea - a model - of how the variables in
   your data are related to each other. You then test your model against the
   observed data and assess how good a fit the model is to the data.

-  In `Multi-Trait Multi-Method (MTMM) CFA
   <Ch15_FactorAnalysis_4.html#multi-trait-multi-method-cfa>`__, both latent
   factor and method variance are included in the model in an approach that is
   useful when there are different methodological approaches used and therefore
   method variance is an important consideration.

-  `Internal consistency reliability analysis
   <Ch15_FactorAnalysis_5.html#internal-consistency-reliability-analysis>`__.
   This form of reliability analysis tests how consistently a scale measures a
   measurement (psychological) construct.
