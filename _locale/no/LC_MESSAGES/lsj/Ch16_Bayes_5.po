"The first half of this chapter was focused primarily on the theoretical "
"underpinnings of Bayesian statistics. I introduced the mathematics for "
"how Bayesian inference works (Section `Probabilistic reasoning by "
"rational agents <Ch16_Bayes_1.html#probabilistic-reasoning-by-rational-"
"agents>`__), and gave a very basic overview of how `Bayesian hypothesis "
"testing <Ch16_Bayes_2.html#bayesian-hypothesis-tests>`__ is typically "
"done. Finally, I devoted some space to talking about why I think Bayesian"
" methods are worth using (Section `Why be a Bayesian? <Ch16_Bayes_3.html"
"#why-be-a-bayesian>`__). Then I gave a practical example, a `Bayesian "
"t-test <Ch16_Bayes_4.html#bayesian-t-tests>`__."

"If you’re interested in learning more about the Bayesian approach, there "
"are many good books you could look into. `John Kruschke’s (2011) "
"<References.html#kruschke-2011>`__ book *Doing Bayesian Data Analysis* is"
" a pretty good place to start and is a nice mix of theory and practice. "
"His approach is a little different to the “Bayes factor” approach that "
"I’ve discussed here, so you won’t be covering the same ground. If you’re "
"a cognitive psychologist, you might want to check out `Michael Lee and "
"Eric-Jan Wagenmakers’ (2014) <References.html#lee-2014>`__ book *Bayesian"
" Cognitive Modeling*. I picked these two because I think they’re "
"especially useful for people in my discipline, but there’s a lot of good "
"books out there, so look around!"
