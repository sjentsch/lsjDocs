Summary
-------

-  A `one sample t-test <Ch11_tTest_02.html#the-one-sample-t-test>`__ is used
   to compare a single sample mean against a hypothesised value for the
   population mean.

-  An `independent samples t-test
   <Ch11_tTest_03.html#the-independent-samples-t-test-student-test>`__ is used
   to compare the means of two groups, and tests the null hypothesis that they
   have the same mean. It comes in two forms: the `Student test
   <Ch11_tTest_03.html#the-independent-samples-t-test-student-test>`__ assumes
   that the groups have the same standard deviation, the `Welch test
   <Ch11_tTest_04.html#the-independent-samples-t-test-welch-test>`__ does not.

-  A `paired samples t-test <Ch11_tTest_05.html#the-paired-samples-t-test>`__
   is used when you have two scores from each person, and you want to test the
   null hypothesis that the two scores have the same mean. It is equivalent to
   taking the difference between the two scores for each person, and then
   running a one sample *t*-test on the difference scores.

-  `One-sided tests <Ch11_tTest_06.html#one-sided-tests>`__ are perfectly
   legitimate as long as they are pre-planned.

-  `Effect size calculations <Ch11_tTest_07.html#effect-size>`__ for the
   difference between means can be calculated via the Cohenâ€™s *d*-statistic.

-  You can check the normality of a sample using QQ plots and the `Shapiro-Wilk
   test <Ch11_tTest_08.html#checking-the-normality-of-a-sample>`__.

-  If your data are non-normal, you can use `Mann-Whitney or Wilcoxon
   tests <Ch11_tTest_09.html#testing-non-normal-data-with-wilcoxon-tests>`__
   instead of *t*-tests.
