"Over the course of the last few chapters we have done quite a lot. We "
"have looked at statistical tests you can use when you have one nominal "
"predictor variable with two groups (e.g. the *t*-test, Chapter `Comparing"
" two means <Ch11_tTest.html#comparing-two-means>`__) or with three or "
"more groups (e.g. in the Chapter `Comparing several means: One-way ANOVA "
"<Ch13_ANOVA.html#comparing-several-means-one-way-anova>`__). The chapter "
"on regression (Chapter `Correlation and linear regression "
"<Ch12_Regression.html#correlation-and-linear-regression>`__) introduced a"
" powerful new idea, that is building statistical models with *multiple* "
"continuous predictor variables used to explain a single outcome variable."
" For instance, a regression model could be used to predict the number of "
"errors a student makes in a reading comprehension test based on the "
"number of hours they studied for the test and their score on a "
"standardised IQ test."

"The goal in this chapter is to extend the idea of using multiple "
"predictors into the ANOVA framework. For instance, suppose we were "
"interested in using the reading comprehension test to measure student "
"achievements in three different schools, and we suspect that girls and "
"boys are developing at different rates (and so would be expected to have "
"different performance on average). Each student is classified in two "
"different ways: on the basis of their gender and on the basis of their "
"school. What we’d like to do is analyse the reading comprehension scores "
"in terms of *both* of these grouping variables. The tool for doing so is "
"generically referred to as **factorial ANOVA**. However, since we have "
"two grouping variables, we sometimes refer to the analysis as a two-way "
"ANOVA, in contrast to the one-way ANOVAs that we ran in Chapter "
"`Comparing several means (one-way ANOVA) <Ch13_ANOVA.html#comparing-"
"several-means-one-way-anova>`__."
