Summary
-------

The first half of this chapter was focused primarily on the theoretical
underpinnings of Bayesian statistics. I introduced the mathematics for how
Bayesian inference works (section :doc:`Probabilistic reasoning by rational
agents <Ch16_Bayes_1>`), and gave a very basic overview of how :doc:`Bayesian
hypothesis testing <Ch16_Bayes_2>` is typically done. Finally, I devoted some
space to talking about why I think Bayesian methods are worth using (section
:doc:`Why be a Bayesian? <Ch16_Bayes_3>`). Then I gave a practical example,
a :doc:`Bayesian t-test <Ch16_Bayes_4>`.

If you’re interested in learning more about the Bayesian approach, there are
many good books you could look into. `John Kruschke’s (2015)
<References.html#kruschke-2015>`__ book *Doing Bayesian Data Analysis* is a
pretty good place to start and is a nice mix of theory and practice. His
approach is a little different to the “Bayes factor” approach that I’ve
discussed here, so you won’t be covering the same ground. If you’re a cognitive
psychologist, you might want to check out `Michael Lee and Eric-Jan
Wagenmakers’ (2014) <References.html#lee-2014>`__ book *Bayesian Cognitive
Modeling*. I picked these two because I think they’re especially useful for
people in my discipline, but there’s a lot of good books out there, so look
around!
