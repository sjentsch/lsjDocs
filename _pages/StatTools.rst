Now that we’ve covered the basic theory behind hypothesis testing, it’s time to
start looking at specific tests that are commonly used in psychology. So where
should we start? Not every textbook agrees on where to start, but I’m going to
start with “χ² tests” (chapter :doc:`Categorical data analysis
<Ch10_ChiSquare>`) and “*t*-tests” (chapter :doc:`Comparing two means
<Ch11_tTest>`). Both of these tools are very frequently used in scientific
practice, and whilst they’re not as powerful as “regression” (see chapter
:doc:`Correlation and linear regression <Ch12_Regression>`) and “Analysis of
Variance” (chapters :doc:`Comparing several means (one-way ANOVA) <Ch13_ANOVA>`
and :doc:`Factorial ANOVA <Ch14_ANOVA2>`) they’re much easier to understand.
Finally, there is a chapter on “Factor analysis” that aims to describe the
variability among observed, correlated variables in terms of a lower number of
unobserved variables called factors or latent Variables (:doc:`Factor Analysis
<Ch15_FactorAnalysis>`).
