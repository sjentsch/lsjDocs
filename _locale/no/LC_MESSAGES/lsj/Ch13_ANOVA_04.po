"There’s a few different ways you could measure the effect size in an "
"ANOVA, but the most commonly used measures are η² (**eta squared**) and "
"partial η². For a one-way analysis of variance they’re identical to each "
"other, so for the moment I’ll just explain η². The definition of η² is "
"actually really simple"

"The interpretation of η² is equally straightforward. It refers to the "
"proportion of the variability in the outcome variable (``mood.gain``) "
"that can be explained in terms of the predictor (``drug``). A value of η²"
" = 0 means that there is no relationship at all between the two, whereas "
"a value of η = 1 means that the relationship is perfect. Better yet, the "
"η² value is very closely related to *R²*, as discussed previously in "
"Section `The R² (R-squared) value <Ch12_Regression_06.html#the-r2-r"
"-squared-value>`__, and has an equivalent interpretation."

"Although many statistics text books suggest η² as the default effect size"
" measure in ANOVA, there’s an interesting blog post by Daniel Lakens "
"suggesting that eta-squared is perhaps not the best measure of effect "
"size in real world data analysis, because it can be a biased estimator "
"(http://daniellakens.blogspot.com.au/2015/06/why-you-should-use-omega-"
"squared.html). Usefully, there is also an option in jamovi to specify "
"omega-squared (ω²), which is less biased, alongside eta-squared."
