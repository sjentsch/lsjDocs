Summary
-------

The first half of this chapter was focused primarily on the theoretical
underpinnings of Bayesian statistics. I introduced the mathematics for
how Bayesian inference works (Section `Probabilistic reasoning by rational
agents <Ch16_Bayes_1.html#probabilistic-reasoning-by-rational-agents>`__),
and gave a very basic overview of how `Bayesian hypothesis testing
<Ch16_Bayes_2.html#bayesian-hypothesis-tests>`__ is typically done.
Finally, I devoted some space to talking about why I think Bayesian
methods are worth using (Section `Why be a Bayesian? 
<Ch16_Bayes_3.html#why-be-a-bayesian>`__). Then I gave a practical example,
a `Bayesian t-test <Ch16_Bayes_4.html#bayesian-t-tests>`__.

If you’re interested in learning more about the Bayesian approach, there are
many good books you could look into.
`John Kruschke’s (2011) <References.html#kruschke-2011>`__ book *Doing Bayesian
Data Analysis* is a pretty good place to start and is a nice mix of theory and
practice. His approach is a little different to the “Bayes factor” approach
that I’ve discussed here, so you won’t be covering the same ground. If you’re a
cognitive psychologist, you might want to check out `Michael Lee and Eric-Jan
Wagenmakers’ (2014) <References.html#lee-2014>`__ book *Bayesian Cognitive
Modeling*. I picked these two because I think they’re especially useful for
people in my discipline, but there’s a lot of good books out there, so look
around!
