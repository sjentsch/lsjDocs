"Okay, time for a little bit of a digression. I’ve been lying to you a "
"little bit so far. There’s a tiny change that you need to make to your "
"calculations whenever you only have 1 degree of freedom. It’s called the "
"“continuity correction”, or sometimes the **Yates correction**. Remember "
"what I pointed out earlier: the χ² test is based on an approximation, "
"specifically on the assumption that the binomial distribution starts to "
"look like a normal distribution for large *N*. One problem with this is "
"that it often doesn’t quite work, especially when you’ve only got 1 "
"degree of freedom (e.g., when you’re doing a test of independence on a 2 "
"· 2 contingency table). The main reason for this is that the true "
"sampling distribution for the *X*\\²-statistic is actually discrete "
"(because you’re dealing with categorical data!) but the χ² distribution "
"is continuous. This can introduce systematic problems. Specifically, when"
" *N* is small and when *df* = 1, the goodness-of-fit statistic tends to "
"be “too big”, meaning that you actually have a bigger *α* value than you "
"think (or, equivalently, the *p* values are a bit too small)."

"As far as I can tell from reading Yates’ paper, the correction is "
"basically a hack. It’s not derived from any principled theory. Rather, "
"it’s based on an examination of the behaviour of the test, and observing "
"that the corrected version seems to work better. You can specify this "
"correction in jamovi from a check box in the ‘Statistics’ options, where "
"it is called ‘χ² continuity correction’."
