"Even within the topics that I have covered in the book, there are a lot "
"of omissions that I’d like to redress in future version of the book. Just"
" sticking to things that are purely about statistics (rather than things "
"associated with jamovi), the following is a representative but not "
"exhaustive list of topics that I’d like to expand on at some time:"

"**Other types of correlations.** In Chapter `Correlation and linear "
"regression <Ch12_Regression.html#correlation-and-linear-regression>`__ I "
"talked about two types of correlation: Pearson and Spearman. Both of "
"these methods of assessing correlation are applicable to the case where "
"you have two continuous variables and want to assess the relationship "
"between them. What about the case where your variables are both nominal "
"scale? Or when one is nominal scale and the other is continuous? There "
"are actually methods for computing correlations in such cases (e.g., "
"polychoric correlation), and it would be good to see these included."

"**More detail on effect sizes.** In general, I think the treatment of "
"effect sizes throughout the book is a little more cursory than it should "
"be. In almost every instance, I’ve tended just to pick one measure of "
"effect size (usually the most popular one) and describe that. However, "
"for almost all tests and models there are multiple ways of thinking about"
" effect size, and I’d like to go into more detail in the future."

"**Dealing with violated assumptions.** In a number of places in the book "
"I’ve talked about some things you can do when you find that the "
"assumptions of your test (or model) are violated, but I think that I "
"ought to say more about this. In particular, I think it would have been "
"nice to talk in a lot more detail about how you can tranform variables to"
" fix problems. I talked a bit about this in the sections `Transforming or"
" recoding a variable <Ch06_DataHandling_3.html#transforming-or-"
"recoding-a-variable>`__ and `Mathematical functions and operations "
"<Ch06_DataHandling_4.html#a-few-more-mathematical-functions-and-"
"operations>`__, but the discussion isn’t detailed enough I think."

"**Interaction terms for regression.** In Chapter `Factorial ANOVA "
"<Ch14_ANOVA2.html#factorial-anova>`__, I talked about the fact that you "
"can have interaction terms in an ANOVA, and I also pointed out that ANOVA"
" can be interpreted as a kind of linear regression model. Yet, when "
"talking about regression in Chapter `Correlation and linear regression "
"<Ch12_Regression.html#correlation-and-linear-regression>`__ I made not "
"mention of interactions at all. However, there’s nothing stopping you "
"from including interaction terms in a regression model. It’s just a "
"little more complicated to figure out what an “interaction” actually "
"means when you’re talking about the interaction between two continuous "
"predictors, and it can be done in more than one way. Even so, I would "
"have liked to talk a little about this."

"**Method of planned comparison.** As I mentioned this in Chapter "
"`Factorial ANOVA <Ch14_ANOVA2.html#factorial-anova>`__, it’s not always "
"appropriate to be using a post-hoc correction like Tukey’s HSD when doing"
" an ANOVA, especially when you had a very clear (and limited) set of "
"comparisons that you cared about ahead of time. I would like to talk more"
" about this in the future."

"**Multiple comparison methods.** Even within the context of talking about"
" post-hoc tests and multiple comparisons, I would have liked to talk "
"about the methods in more detail, and talk about what other methods exist"
" besides the few options I mentioned."
