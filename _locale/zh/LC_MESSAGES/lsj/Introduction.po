"In this chapter I’ll discuss how to get started in jamovi. I’ll briefly "
"talk about how to download and install jamovi, but most of the chapter "
"will be focused on getting you started with finding your way around the "
"jamovi GUI. Our goal in this chapter is not to learn any statistical "
"concepts: we’re just trying to learn the basics of how jamovi works and "
"get comfortable interacting with the system. To do this we’ll spend a bit"
" of time looking at datasets and variables. In doing so, you’ll get a bit"
" of a feel for what it’s like to work in jamovi."

"However, before going into any of the specifics, it’s worth talking a "
"little about why you might want to use jamovi at all. Given that you’re "
"reading this you’ve probably got your own reasons. However, if those "
"reasons are “because that’s what my stats class uses”, it might be worth "
"explaining a little why your lecturer has chosen to use jamovi for the "
"class. Of course, I don’t really know why *other* people choose jamovi so"
" I’m really talking about why I use it."

"It’s sort of obvious but worth saying anyway: doing your statistics on a "
"computer is faster, easier and more powerful than doing statistics by "
"hand. Computers excel at mindless repetitive tasks, and a lot of "
"statistical calculations are both mindless and repetitive. For most "
"people the only reason to ever do statistical calculations with pencil "
"and paper is for learning purposes. In my class I do occasionally suggest"
" doing some calculations that way, but the only real value to it is "
"pedagogical. It does help you to get a “feel” for statistics to do some "
"calculations yourself, so it’s worth doing it once. But only once!"

"Doing statistics in a conventional spreadsheet (e.g., Microsoft Excel) is"
" generally a bad idea in the long run. Although many people likely feel "
"more familiar with them, spreadsheets are very limited in terms of what "
"analyses they allow you do. If you get into the habit of trying to do "
"your real life data analysis using spreadsheets then you’ve dug yourself "
"into a very deep hole."

"Avoiding proprietary software is a very good idea. There are a lot of "
"commercial packages out there that you can buy, some of which I like and "
"some of which I don’t. They’re usually very glossy in their appearance "
"and generally very powerful (much more powerful than spreadsheets). "
"However, they’re also very expensive. Usually, the company sells “student"
" versions” (crippled versions of the real thing) very cheaply, and then "
"they they sell full powered “educational versions” at a price that makes "
"me wince. They will also sell commercial licences with a staggeringly "
"high price tag. The business model here is to suck you in during your "
"student days and then leave you dependent on their tools when you go out "
"into the real world. It’s hard to blame them for trying, but personally "
"I’m not in favour of shelling out thousands of dollars if I can avoid it."
" And you can avoid it. If you make use of packages like jamovi that are "
"open source and free you never get trapped having to pay exorbitant "
"licensing fees."

"Something that you might not appreciate now, but will love later on if "
"you do anything involving data analysis, is the fact that jamovi is "
"basically a sophisticated front end for the free R statistical "
"programming language. When you download and install R you get all the "
"basic “packages” and those are very powerful on their own. However, "
"because R is so open and so widely used, it’s become something of a "
"standard tool in statistics and so lots of people write their own "
"packages that extend the system. And these are freely available too. One "
"of the consequences of this, I’ve noticed, is that if you look at recent "
"advanced data analysis textbooks then a *lot* of them use R."

"Those are the main reasons I use jamovi. It’s not without its flaws, "
"though. It’s relatively new\\ [#]_ so there is not a huge set of "
"textbooks and other resources to support it, and it has a few annoying "
"quirks that we’re all pretty much stuck with, but on the whole I think "
"the strengths outweigh the weakness; more so than any other option I’ve "
"encountered so far."
