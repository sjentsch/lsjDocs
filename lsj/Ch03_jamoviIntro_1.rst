Installing jamovi
-----------------

Okay, enough with the sales pitch. Let’s get started. Just as with any
piece of software, jamovi needs to be installed on a “computer”, which
is a magical box that does cool things and delivers free ponies. Or
something along those lines; I may be confusing computers with the iPad
marketing campaigns. Anyway, jamovi is freely distributed online and you
can download it from the jamovi homepage, which is:

   https://www.jamovi.org/

At the top of the page, under the heading “Download”, you’ll see
separate links for Windows users, Mac users, and Linux users. If you
follow the relevant link you’ll see that the online instructions are
pretty self-explanatory.\ [#]_

Starting up jamovi
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One way or another, regardless of what operating system you’re using,
it’s time to open jamovi and get started. When first starting jamovi you
will be presented with a user interface which looks something like
:numref:`fig-startjamovi`.

.. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. _fig-startjamovi:
.. figure:: ../_images/lsj_startingjamovi.*
   :alt: jamovi start window

   jamovi looks like this when you start it.

.. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

To the left is the spreadsheet view, and to the right is where the
results of statistical tests appear. Down the middle is a bar separating
these two regions and this can be dragged to the left or the right to
change their sizes.

It is possible to simply begin typing values into the jamovi spreadsheet
as you would in any other spreadsheet software. Alternatively, existing
data sets in the CSV (.csv) file format can be opened in jamovi.
Additionally, you can easily import Excel, LibreOffice, SPSS, SAS, Stata
and JASP files directly into jamovi. To open a file select the File tab
(three horizontal lines; top left hand corner), select ``Open`` and then
choose from the files listed on ``Browse`` depending on whether you want to
open an example or a file stored on your computer.

Analyses
--------

Analyses can be selected from the analysis ribbon or menu along the top.
Selecting an analysis will present an **options panel** for that particular
analysis, allowing you to assign different variables to different parts of the
analysis, and select different options. At the same time, the results for the
analysis will appear in the right **results panel** and will update in real-
time as you make changes to the options.

When you have the analysis set up correctly you can dismiss the analysis
options by clicking the arrow to the top right of the optional panel. If
you wish to return to these options, you can click on the results that
were produced. In this way, you can return to any analysis that you (or
say, a colleague) created earlier.

If you decide you no longer need a particular analysis, you can remove
it with the results context menu. Right-clicking on the analysis results
will bring up a menu and by selecting ``Analysis`` and then ``Remove`` the
analysis can be removed. But more on this later. First, let’s take a
more detailed look at the spreadsheet view.

   Although jamovi is updated frequently it doesn’t usually make much of
   a difference for the sort of work we’ll do in this book. In fact,
   during the writing of the book I upgraded several times and it didn’t
   make much difference at all to what is in this book.
