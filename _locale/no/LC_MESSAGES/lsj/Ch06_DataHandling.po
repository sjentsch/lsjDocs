"This is a somewhat strange chapter, even by my standards. My goal in this"
" chapter is to talk a bit more honestly about the realities of working "
"with data than you’ll see anywhere else in the book. The problem with "
"real world data sets is that they are *messy*. Very often the data file "
"that you start out with doesn’t have the variables stored in the right "
"format for the analysis you want to do. Sometimes there might be a lot of"
" missing values in your data set. Sometimes you only want to analyse a "
"subset of the data. Et cetera. In other words, there’s a lot of **data "
"manipulation** that you need to do just to get the variables in your data"
" set into the format that you need it. The purpose of this chapter is to "
"provide a basic introduction to these pragmatic topics. Although the "
"chapter is motivated by the kinds of practical issues that arise when "
"manipulating real data, I’ll stick with the practice that I’ve adopted "
"through most of the book and rely on very small, toy data sets that "
"illustrate the underlying issue. Because this chapter is essentially a "
"collection of techniques and doesn’t tell a single coherent story, it may"
" be useful to start with a list of topics:"

"As you can see, the list of topics that the chapter covers is pretty "
"broad, and there’s a *lot* of content there. Even though this is one of "
"the longest and hardest chapters in the book, I’m really only scratching "
"the surface of several fairly different and important topics. My advice, "
"as usual, is to read through the chapter once and try to follow as much "
"of it as you can. Don’t worry too much if you can’t grasp it all at once,"
" especially the later sections. The rest of the book is only lightly "
"reliant on this chapter so you can get away with just understanding the "
"basics. However, what you’ll probably find is that later on you’ll need "
"to flick back to this chapter in order to understand some of the concepts"
" that I refer to here."
