"Let’s begin with the humble **histogram**. Histograms are one of the "
"simplest and most useful ways of visualising data. They make most sense "
"when you have an interval or ratio scale variable (e.g., the "
"``afl.margins`` data that we used in `Descriptive statistics "
"<Ch04_Descriptives.html#descriptive-statistics>`__ ) and what you want to"
" do is get an overall impression of the variable. Most of you probably "
"know how histograms work, since they’re so widely used, but for the sake "
"of completeness I’ll describe them. All you do is divide up the possible "
"values into **bins** and then count the number of observations that fall "
"within each bin. This count is referred to as the frequency or density of"
" the bin and is displayed as a vertical bar. Ihe AFL winning margins data"
" there are 33 games in which the winning margin was less than 10 points "
"and it is this fact that is represented by the height of the leftmost bar"
" that we showed earlier in `Descriptive statistics "
"<Ch04_Descriptives.html#descriptive-statistics>`__, and :numref:`fig-"
"aflMargins`. With these earlier graphs we used an advanced plotting "
"package in R which, for now, is beyond the capability of jamovi. But "
"jamovi gets us close, and drawing this histogram in jamovi is pretty "
"straightforward. Open up the ``Plots`` options under ``Exploration`` → "
"``Descriptives`` and click the ``Histogram`` check box, as shown in "
":numref:`fig-jamovi_histogram`. jamovi defaults to labelling the y-axis "
"as ‘density’ and the x-axis with the variable name. The **bins** are "
"selected automatically, and there is no scale, or count, information on "
"the y-axis unlike the previous :numref:`fig-aflMargins`. But this does "
"not matter too much because after all what we are really interested in is"
" our impression of the shape of the distribution: is it normally "
"distributed or is there a skew or kurtosis? Our first impressions of "
"these characteristics come from drawing a **histogram**."

"One additional feature that jamovi provides is the ability to plot a "
"density curve. You can do this by clicking the ``Density`` check box "
"under the ``Plots`` options (and unchecking ``Histogram``), and this "
"gives us the plot shown in :numref:`fig-histogram2`. A density plot "
"visualises the distribution of data over a continuous interval or time "
"period. This chart is a variation of a histogram that uses **kernel "
"smoothing** to plot values, allowing for smoother distributions by "
"smoothing out the noise. The peaks of a density plot help display where "
"values are concentrated over the interval. An advantage density plots "
"have over histograms is that they are better at determining the "
"distribution shape because they’re not affected by the number of bins "
"used (each bar used in a typical histogram). A histogram comprising of "
"only 4 bins wouldn’t produce a distinguishable enough shape of "
"distribution as a 20-bin histogram would. However, with density plots, "
"this isn’t an issue."

"Although this image would need a lot of cleaning up in order to make a "
"good presentation graphic (i.e., one you’d include in a report), it "
"nevertheless does a pretty good job of describing the data. In fact, the "
"big strength of a histogram or density plot is that (properly used) it "
"does show the entire spread of the data, so you can get a pretty good "
"sense about what it looks like. The downside to histograms is that they "
"aren’t very compact. Unlike some of the other plots I’ll talk about it’s "
"hard to cram 20-30 histograms into a single image without overwhelming "
"the viewer. And of course, if your data are nominal scale then histograms"
" are useless."
