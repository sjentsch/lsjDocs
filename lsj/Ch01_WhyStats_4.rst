Statistics in psychology
------------------------

I hope that the discussion above helped explain why science in general
is so focused on statistics. But I’m guessing that you have a lot more
questions about what role statistics plays in psychology, and
specifically why psychology classes always devote so many lectures to
stats. So here’s my attempt to answer a few of them...

-  **Why does psychology have so much statistics?**

   To be perfectly honest, there’s a few different reasons, some of
   which are better than others. The most important reason is that
   psychology is a statistical science. What I mean by that is that the
   “things” that we study are *people*. Real, complicated, gloriously
   messy, infuriatingly perverse people. The “things” of physics include
   objects like electrons, and while there are all sorts of complexities
   that arise in physics, electrons don’t have minds of their own. They
   don’t have opinions, they don’t differ from each other in weird and
   arbitrary ways, they don’t get bored in the middle of an experiment,
   and they don’t get angry at the experimenter and then deliberately
   try to sabotage the data set (not that I’ve ever done that!). At a
   fundamental level psychology is harder than physics.\ [#]_

   Basically, we teach statistics to you as psychologists because you
   need to be better at stats than physicists. There’s actually a saying
   used sometimes in physics, to the effect that “if your experiment
   needs statistics, you should have done a better experiment". They
   have the luxury of being able to say that because their objects of
   study are pathetically simple in comparison to the vast mess that
   confronts social scientists. And it’s not just psychology. Most
   social sciences are desperately reliant on statistics. Not because
   we’re bad experimenters, but because we’ve picked a harder problem to
   solve. We teach you stats because you really, really need it.

-  **Can’t someone else do the statistics?**

   To some extent, but not completely. It’s true that you don’t need to
   become a fully trained statistician just to do psychology, but you do
   need to reach a certain level of statistical competence. In my view,
   there’s three reasons that every psychological researcher ought to be
   able to do basic statistics:

   -  Firstly, there’s the fundamental reason: statistics is deeply
      intertwined with research design. If you want to be good at
      designing psychological studies, you need to at the very least
      understand the basics of stats.

   -  Secondly, if you want to be good at the psychological side of the
      research, then you need to be able to understand the psychological
      literature, right? But almost every paper in the psychological
      literature reports the results of statistical analyses. So if you
      really want to understand the psychology, you need to be able to
      understand what other people did with their data. And that means
      understanding a certain amount of statistics.

   -  Thirdly, there’s a big practical problem with being dependent on
      other people to do all your statistics: statistical analysis is
      *expensive*. If you ever get bored and want to look up how much
      the Australian government charges for university fees, you’ll
      notice something interesting: statistics is designated as a
      “national priority” category, and so the fees are much, much lower
      than for any other area of study. This is because there’s a
      massive shortage of statisticians out there. So, from your
      perspective as a psychological researcher, the laws of supply and
      demand aren’t exactly on your side here! As a result, in almost
      any real life situation where you want to do psychological
      research, the cruel facts will be that you don’t have enough money
      to afford a statistician. So the economics of the situation mean
      that you have to be pretty self-sufficient.

   Note that a lot of these reasons generalise beyond researchers. If
   you want to be a practicing psychologist and stay on top of the
   field, it helps to be able to read the scientific literature, which
   relies pretty heavily on statistics.

-  **I don’t care about jobs, research, or clinical work. Do I need
   statistics?**

   Okay, now you’re just messing with me. Still, I think it should
   matter to you too. Statistics should matter to you in the same way
   that statistics should matter to *everyone*. We live in the 21st
   century, and data are *everywhere*. Frankly, given the world in which
   we live these days, a basic knowledge of statistics is pretty damn
   close to a survival tool! Which is the topic of the next section.

   Which might explain why physics is just a teensy bit further advanced
   as a science than we are.
