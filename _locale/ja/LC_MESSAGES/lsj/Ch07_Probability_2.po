"Let’s start with the first of these questions. What is “probability”? It "
"might seem surprising to you but while statisticians and mathematicians "
"(mostly) agree on what the *rules* of probability are, there’s much less "
"of a consensus on what the word really *means*. It seems weird because "
"we’re all very comfortable using words like “chance”, “likely”, "
"“possible” and “probable”, and it doesn’t seem like it should be a very "
"difficult question to answer. But if you’ve ever had that experience in "
"real life you might walk away from the conversation feeling like you "
"didn’t quite get it right, and that (like many everyday concepts) it "
"turns out that you don’t *really* know what it’s all about."

"Notice that at the start of the sequence the *proportion* of heads "
"fluctuates wildly, starting at 0.00 and rising as high as 0.80. Later on,"
" one gets the impression that it dampens out a bit, with more and more of"
" the values actually being pretty close to the “right” answer of 0.50. "
"This is the frequentist definition of probability in a nutshell. Flip a "
"fair coin over and over again, and as *N* grows large (approaches "
"infinity, denoted *N* → ∞) the proportion of heads will converge to 50%. "
"There are some subtle technicalities that the mathematicians care about, "
"but qualitatively speaking that’s how the frequentists define "
"probability. Unfortunately, I don’t have an infinite number of coins or "
"the infinite patience required to flip a coin an infinite number of "
"times. However, I do have a computer and computers excel at mindless "
"repetitive tasks. So I asked my computer to simulate flipping a coin 1000"
" times and then drew a picture of what happens to the proportion *N*\\ "
":sub:`H` / *N* as *N* increases. Actually, I did it four times just to "
"make sure it wasn’t a fluke. The results are shown in :numref:`fig-"
"frequentistProb`. As you can see, the *proportion of observed heads* "
"eventually stops fluctuating and settles down. When it does, the number "
"at which it finally settles is the true probability of heads."

"The frequentist definition of probability has some desirable "

" occur in the physical universe.\\ [#]_ Secondly, it is unambiguous. Any "

"However, it also has undesirable characteristics. First, infinite "
"sequences don’t exist in the physical world. Suppose you picked up a coin"
" from your pocket and started to flip it. Every time it lands it impacts "
"on the ground. Each impact wears the coin down a bit. Eventually the coin"
" will be destroyed. So, one might ask whether it really makes sense to "
"pretend that an “infinite” sequence of coin flips is even a meaningful "
"concept, or an objective one. We can’t say that an “infinite sequence” of"
" events is a real thing in the physical universe, because the physical "
"universe doesn’t allow infinite anything. More seriously, the frequentist"
" definition has a narrow scope. There are lots of things out there that "
"human beings are happy to assign probability to in everyday language, but"
" cannot (even in theory) be mapped onto a hypothetical sequence of "
"events. For instance, if a meteorologist comes on TV and says “the "
"probability of rain in Adelaide on 2 November 2048 is 60%” we humans are "
"happy to accept this. But it’s not clear how to define this in "
"frequentist terms. There’s only one city of Adelaide, and only one 2 "
"November 2048. There’s no infinite sequence of events here, just a one-"
"off thing. Frequentist probability genuinely *forbids* us from making "
"probability statements about a single event. From the frequentist "
"perspective it will either rain tomorrow or it will not. There is no "
"“probability” that attaches to a single non-repeatable event. Now, it "
"should be said that there are some very clever tricks that frequentists "
"can use to get around this. One possibility is that what the "
"meteorologist means is something like “There is a category of days for "
"which I predict a 60% chance of rain, and if we look only across those "
"days for which I make this prediction, then on 60% of those days it will "
"actually rain”. It’s very weird and counterintuitive to think of it this "
"way, but you do see frequentists do this sometimes. And it *will* come up"
" later in this book (see `Estimating a confidence interval "
"<Ch08_Estimation_5.html#estimating-a-confidence-interval>`__)."

msgid ""
"The **Bayesian view** of probability is often called the subjectivist "
"view, and although it has been a minority view among statisticians it has"
" been steadily gaining traction for the last several decades. There are "
"many flavours of Bayesianism, making it hard to say exactly what “the” "
"Bayesian view is. The most common way of thinking about subjective "
"probability is to define the probability of an event as the **degree of "
"belief** that an intelligent and rational agent assigns to that truth of "
"that event. From that perspective, probabilities don’t exist in the world"
" but rather in the thoughts and assumptions of people and other "
"intelligent beings."

"However, in order for this approach to work we need some way of "
"operationalising “degree of belief”. One way that you can do this is to "
"formalise it in terms of “rational gambling”, though there are many other"
" ways. Suppose that I believe that there’s a 60% probability of rain "
"tomorrow. If someone offers me a bet that if it rains tomorrow then I win"
" $5, but if it doesn’t rain I lose $5. Clearly, from my perspective, this"
" is a pretty good bet. On the other hand, if I think that the probability"
" of rain is only 40% then it’s a bad bet to take. So we can "
"operationalise the notion of a “subjective probability” in terms of what "
"bets I’m willing to accept."

"What are the advantages and disadvantages to the Bayesian approach? The "
"main advantage is that it allows you to assign probabilities to any event"
" you want to. You don’t need to be limited to those events that are "
"repeatable. The main disadvantage (to many people) is that we can’t be "
"purely objective. Specifying a probability requires us to specify an "
"entity that has the relevant degree of belief. This entity might be a "
"human, an alien, a robot, or even a statistician. But there has to be an "
"intelligent agent out there that believes in things. To many people this "
"is uncomfortable, it seems to make probability arbitrary. Whilst the "
"Bayesian approach requires that the agent in question be rational (i.e., "
"obey the rules of probability), it does allow everyone to have their own "
"beliefs. I can believe the coin is fair and you don’t have to, even "
"though we’re both rational. The frequentist view doesn’t allow any two "
"observers to attribute different probabilities to the same event. When "
"that happens then at least one of them must be wrong. The Bayesian view "
"does not prevent this from occurring. Two observers with different "
"background knowledge can legitimately hold different beliefs about the "
"same event. In short, where the frequentist view is sometimes considered "
"to be too narrow (forbids lots of things that that we want to assign "
"probabilities to), the Bayesian view is sometimes thought to be too broad"
" (allows too many differences between observers)."
