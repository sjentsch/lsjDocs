"It is very commonly the case that you find yourself needing to look at "
"descriptive statistics broken down by some grouping variable. This is "
"pretty easy to do in jamovi. For instance, let’s say I want to look at "
"the descriptive statistics for some ``clin.trial`` data, broken down "
"separately by ``therapy`` type. This is a new data set, one that you’ve "
"never seen before. The data is stored in the ``clinicaltrial.csv`` file "
"and we’ll use it a lot in Chapter `Comparing several means (one-way "
"ANOVA) <Ch13_ANOVA.html#comparing-several-means-one-way-anova>`__ (you "
"can find a complete description of the data at the start of that "
"chapter). Let’s load it and see what we’ve got:"

"Evidently there were three drugs: a placebo, something called “anxifree” "
"and something called “joyzepam”, and there were 6 people administered "
"each drug. There were 9 people treated using cognitive behavioural "
"therapy (CBT) and 9 people who received no psychological treatment. And "
"we can see from looking at the ``Descriptives`` of the ``mood.gain`` "
"variable that most people did show a mood gain (mean = 0.88), though "
"without knowing what the scale is here it’s hard to say much more than "
"that. Still, that’s not too bad. Overall I feel that I learned something "
"from that."

"We can also go ahead and look at some other descriptive statistics, and "
"this time separately for each type of therapy. In jamovi, check Std. "
"deviation, Skewness and Kurtosis in the ``Statistics`` options. At the "
"same time, transfer the ``therapy`` variable into the ``Split by`` box, "
"and you should get something like :numref:`fig-clinicaltrial_grouping`."

"What if you have multiple grouping variables? Suppose you want to look at"
" the average mood gain separately for all possible combinations of drug "
"and therapy. It is possible to do this by adding another variable, "
"``drug``, into the ``Split by`` box. Easy peasy, though sometimes if you "
"split too much there isn’t enough data in each breakdown combination to "
"make meaningful calculations. In this case jamovi tells you this by "
"stating something like ``NaN`` or ``Inf``.\\ [#]_"

"Sometimes jamovi will also present numbers in an unusual way. If a number"
" is very small, or very large, then jamovi switches to an exponential "
"form for numbers. For example **6.51e-4** is the same as saying that the "
"decimal point is moved 4 places to the left, so the actual number is "
"**0.000651**. If there is a plus sign (i.e. **6.51e+4** then the decimal "
"point is moved to the right, i.e. **65,100.00**. Usually only very small "
"or very large numbers are expressed in this way, for example "
"**6.51e-16**, which would be quite unwieldy to write out in the normal "
"way."
