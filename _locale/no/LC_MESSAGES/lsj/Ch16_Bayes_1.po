"From a Bayesian perspective statistical inference is all about *belief "
"revision*. I start out with a set of candidate hypotheses *h* about the "
"world. I don’t know which of these hypotheses is true, but do I have some"
" beliefs about which hypotheses are plausible and which are not. When I "
"observe the data, *d*, I have to revise those beliefs. If the data are "
"consistent with a hypothesis, my belief in that hypothesis is "
"strengthened. If the data are inconsistent with the hypothesis, my belief"
" in that hypothesis is weakened. That’s it! At the end of this section "
"I’ll give a precise description of how Bayesian reasoning works, but "
