"Any time that you get a new data set to look at one of the first tasks "
"that you have to do is find ways of summarising the data in a compact, "
"easily understood fashion. This is what **descriptive statistics** (as "
"opposed to inferential statistics) is all about. In fact, to many people "
"the term “statistics” is synonymous with descriptive statistics. It is "
"this topic that we’ll consider in this chapter, but before going into any"
" details, let’s take a moment to get a sense of why we need descriptive "
"statistics. To do this, let’s open the ``aflsmall_margins`` file and see "
"what variables are stored in the file."

"In fact, there is just one variable here, ``afl.margins``. We’ll focus a "
"bit on this variable in this chapter, so I’d better tell you what it is. "
"Unlike most of the data sets in this book, this is actually real data, "
"relating to the Australian Football League (AFL).\\ [#]_ The "
"``afl.margins`` variable contains the winning margin (number of points) "
"for all 176 home and away games played during the 2010 season."

"This output doesn’t make it easy to get a sense of what the data are "
"actually saying. Just “looking at the data” isn’t a terribly effective "
"way of understanding data. In order to get some idea about what the data "
"are actually saying we need to calculate some descriptive statistics "
"(this chapter) and draw some nice pictures (Chapter `Drawing graphs "
"<Ch05_Graphics.html>`__). Since the descriptive statistics are the easier"
" of the two topics I’ll start with those, but nevertheless I’ll show you "
"a histogram of the ``afl.margins`` data since it should help you get a "
"sense of what the data we’re trying to describe actually look like, see "
":numref:`fig-aflMargins`. We’ll talk a lot more about how to draw "
"`histograms <Ch05_Graphics_1.html#histograms>`__. For now, it’s enough to"
" look at the histogram and note that it provides a fairly interpretable "
"representation of the ``afl.margins`` data."
