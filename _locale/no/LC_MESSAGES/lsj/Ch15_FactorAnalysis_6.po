"In this chapter on factor analysis and related techniques we have "
"introduced and demonstrated statistical analyses that assess the pattern "
"of relationships in a data set. Specifically, we have covered:"

"`Exploratory Factor Analysis <Ch15_FactorAnalysis_1.html#exploratory-"
"factor-analysis>`__  (EFA). EFA is a statistical technique for "
"identifying underlying latent factors in a data set. Each observed "
"variable is conceptualised as representing the latent factor to some "
"extent, indicated by a factor loading. Researchers also use EFA as a way "
"of data reduction, i.e. identifying observed variables than can be "
"combined into new factor variables for subsequent analysis."

"`Principal Component Analysis <Ch15_FactorAnalysis_2.html#principal-"
"component-analysis>`__ (PCA) is a data reduction technique which, "
"strictly speaking, does not identify underlying latent factors. Instead, "
"PCA simply produces a linear combination of observed variables."

"`Confirmatory Factor Analysis <Ch15_FactorAnalysis_3.html#confirmatory-"
"factor-analysis>`__ (CFA). Unlike EFA, with CFA you start with an idea - "
"a model - of how the variables in your data are related to each other. "
"You then test your model against the observed data and assess how good a "
"fit the model is to the data."

"In `Multi-Trait Multi-Method (MTMM) CFA <Ch15_FactorAnalysis_4.html"
"#multi-trait-multi-method-cfa>`__, both latent factor and method variance"
" are included in the model in an approach that is useful when there are "
"different methodological approaches used and therefore method variance is"
" an important consideration."
