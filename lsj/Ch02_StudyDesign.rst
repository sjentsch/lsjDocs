A brief introduction to research design
=======================================

.. epigraph::

   | *To consult the statistician after an experiment is finished is
     often merely to ask him to conduct a post mortem examination. He
     can perhaps say what the experiment died of.*
     
   -- Sir Ronald Fisher\ [#]_

In this chapter, we’re going to start thinking about the basic ideas
that go into designing a study, collecting data, checking whether your
data collection works, and so on. It won’t give you enough information
to allow you to design studies of your own, but it will give you a lot
of the basic tools that you need to assess the studies done by other
people. However, since the focus of this book is much more on data
analysis than on data collection, I’m only giving a very brief overview.
Note that this chapter is “special” in two ways. Firstly, it’s much more
psychology-specific than the later chapters. Secondly, it focuses much
more heavily on the scientific problem of research methodology, and much
less on the statistical problem of data analysis. Nevertheless, the two
problems are related to one another, so it’s traditional for stats
textbooks to discuss the problem in a little detail. This chapter relies
heavily on `Campbell and Stanley (1963) <References.html#campbell-1963>`__
for the discussion of study design, and `Stevens (1946)
<References.html#stevens-1946>`__ for the discussion of scales of measurement.
