"In this chapter I’ve covered two main topics. The first half of the "
"chapter talks about sampling theory, and the second half talks about how "
"we can use sampling theory to construct estimates of the population "
"parameters. The section breakdown looks like this:"

"As always, there’s a lot of topics related to sampling and estimation "
"that aren’t covered in this chapter, but for an introductory psychology "
"class this is fairly comprehensive I think. For most applied researchers "
"you won’t need much more theory than this. One big question that I "
"haven’t touched on in this chapter is what you do when you don’t have a "
"simple random sample. There is a lot of statistical theory you can draw "
"on to handle this situation, but it’s well beyond the scope of this book."
