An introduction to jamovi

In this chapter I’ll discuss how to get started in jamovi. I’ll briefly
talk about how to download and install jamovi, but most of the chapter
will be focused on getting you started with finding your way around the
jamovi GUI. Our goal in this chapter is not to learn any statistical
concepts: we’re just trying to learn the basics of how jamovi works and
get comfortable interacting with the system. To do this we’ll spend a
bit of time looking at datasets and variables. In doing so, you’ll get a
bit of a feel for what it’s like to work in jamovi.

However, before going into any of the specifics, it’s worth talking a
little about why you might want to use jamovi at all. Given that you’re
reading this you’ve probably got your own reasons. However, if those
reasons are “because that’s what my stats class uses”, it might be worth
explaining a little why your lecturer has chosen to use jamovi for the
class. Of course, I don’t really know why *other* people choose jamovi
so I’m really talking about why I use it.

-  It’s sort of obvious but worth saying anyway: doing your statistics
   on a computer is faster, easier and more powerful than doing
   statistics by hand. Computers excel at mindless repetitive tasks, and
   a lot of statistical calculations are both mindless and repetitive.
   For most people the only reason to ever do statistical calculations
   with pencil and paper is for learning purposes. In my class I do
   occasionally suggest doing some calculations that way, but the only
   real value to it is pedagogical. It does help you to get a “feel” for
   statistics to do some calculations yourself, so it’s worth doing it
   once. But only once!

-  Doing statistics in a conventional spreadsheet (e.g., Microsoft
   Excel) is generally a bad idea in the long run. Although many people
   likely feel more familiar with them, spreadsheets are very limited in
   terms of what analyses they allow you do. If you get into the habit
   of trying to do your real life data analysis using spreadsheets then
   you’ve dug yourself into a very deep hole.

-  Avoiding proprietary software is a very good idea. There are a lot of
   commercial packages out there that you can buy, some of which I like
   and some of which I don’t. They’re usually very glossy in their
   appearance and generally very powerful (much more powerful than
   spreadsheets). However, they’re also very expensive. Usually, the
   company sells “student versions” (crippled versions of the real
   thing) very cheaply, and then they they sell full powered
   “educational versions” at a price that makes me wince. They will also
   sell commercial licences with a staggeringly high price tag. The
   business model here is to suck you in during your student days and
   then leave you dependent on their tools when you go out into the real
   world. It’s hard to blame them for trying, but personally I’m not in
   favour of shelling out thousands of dollars if I can avoid it. And
   you can avoid it. If you make use of packages like jamovi that are
   open source and free you never get trapped having to pay exorbitant
   licensing fees.

-  Something that you might not appreciate now, but will love later on
   if you do anything involving data analysis, is the fact that jamovi
   is basically a sophisticated front end for the free R statistical
   programming language. When you download and install R you get all the
   basic “packages” and those are very powerful on their own. However,
   because R is so open and so widely used, it’s become something of a
   standard tool in statistics and so lots of people write their own
   packages that extend the system. And these are freely available too.
   One of the consequences of this, I’ve noticed, is that if you look at
   recent advanced data analysis textbooks then a *lot* of them use R.

Those are the main reasons I use jamovi. It’s not without its flaws,
though. It’s relatively new\ [#]_ so there is not a huge set of textbooks
and other resources to support it, and it has a few annoying quirks that
we’re all pretty much stuck with, but on the whole I think the strengths
outweigh the weakness; more so than any other option I’ve encountered so
far.
