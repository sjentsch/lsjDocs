.. epigraph::
   | *“Begin at the beginning”*, the King said, very gravely,
   | *“and go on till you come to the end: then stop”*
   
   -- Lewis Carroll
   
It feels somewhat strange to be writing this chapter, and more than a little
inappropriate. An epilogue is what you write when a work is finished. However,
there are a lot of things still missing, including a lot of references.
