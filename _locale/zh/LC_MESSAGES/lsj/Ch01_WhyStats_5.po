"When I started writing up my lecture notes I took the 20 most recent news"
" articles posted to the ABC news website. Of those 20 articles, it turned"
" out that 8 of them involved a discussion of something that I would call "
"a statistical topic and 6 of those made a mistake. The most common error,"
" if you’re curious, was failing to report baseline data (e.g., the "
"article mentions that 5% of people in situation X have some "
"characteristic Y, but doesn’t say how common the characteristic is for "
"everyone else!). The point I’m trying to make here isn’t that journalists"
" are bad at statistics (though they almost always are), it’s that a basic"
" knowledge of statistics is very helpful for trying to figure out when "
"someone else is either making a mistake or even lying to you. In fact, "
"one of the biggest things that a knowledge of statistics does to you is "
"cause you to get angry at the newspaper or the internet on a far more "
"frequent basis. You can find a good example of this in the section `A "
"real life example <Ch04_Descriptives_1.html#a-real-life-example>`__. In "
"later versions of this book I’ll try to include more anecdotes along "
"those lines."

"So far, most of what I’ve talked about is statistics, and so you’d be "
"forgiven for thinking that statistics is all I care about in life. To be "
"fair, you wouldn’t be far wrong, but research methodology is a broader "
"concept than statistics. So most research methods courses will cover a "
"lot of topics that relate much more to the pragmatics of research design,"
" and in particular the issues that you encounter when trying to do "
"research with humans. However, about 99% of student *fears* relate to the"
" statistics part of the course, so I’ve focused on the stats in this "
"discussion, and hopefully I’ve convinced you that statistics matters, and"
" more importantly, that it’s not to be feared. That being said, it’s "
"pretty typical for introductory research methods classes to be very "
"stats-heavy. This is not (usually) because the lecturers are evil people."
" Quite the contrary, in fact. Introductory classes focus a lot on the "
"statistics because you almost always find yourself needing statistics "
"before you need the other research methods training. Why? Because almost "
"all of your assignments in other classes will rely on statistical "
"training, to a much greater extent than they rely on other methodological"
" tools. It’s not common for undergraduate assignments to require you to "
"design your own study from the ground up (in which case you would need to"
" know a lot about research design), but it *is* common for assignments to"
" ask you to analyse and interpret data that were collected in a study "
"that someone else designed (in which case you need statistics). In that "
"sense, from the perspective of allowing you to do well in all your other "
"classes, the statistics is more urgent."

"But note that “urgent” is different from “important” – they both matter. "
"I really do want to stress that research design is just as important as "
"data analysis, and this book does spend a fair amount of time on it. "
"However, while statistics has a kind of universality, and provides a set "
"of core tools that are useful for most types of psychological research, "
"the research methods side isn’t quite so universal. There are some "
"general principles that everyone should think about, but a lot of "
"research design is very idiosyncratic, and is specific to the area of "
"research that you want to engage in. To the extent that it’s the details "
"that matter, those details don’t usually show up in an introductory stats"
" and research methods class."
