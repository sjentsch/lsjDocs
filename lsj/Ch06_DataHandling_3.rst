Transforming and recoding a variable
------------------------------------

It’s not uncommon in real world data analysis to find that one of your
variables isn’t quite equivalent to the variable that you really want.
For instance, it’s often convenient to take a continuous-valued variable
(e.g., age) and break it up into a smallish number of categories (e.g.,
younger, middle, older). At other times, you may need to convert a
numeric variable into a different numeric variable (e.g., you may want
to analyse at the absolute value of the original variable). In this
section I’ll describe a few key ways you can do these things in jamovi.

Creating a transformed variable
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The first trick to discuss is the idea of **transforming** a variable.
Taken literally, *anything* you do to a variable is a transformation,
but in practice what it usually means is that you apply a relatively
simple mathematical function to the original variable in order to create
a new variable that either (a) provides a better way of describing the
thing you’re actually interested in, or (b) is more closely in agreement
with the assumptions of the statistical tests you want to do. Since, at
this stage, I haven’t talked about statistical tests or their
assumptions, I’ll show you an example based on the first case.

Suppose I’ve run a short study in which I ask 10 people a single
question:

   On a scale of 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree), to what
   extent do you agree with the proposition that “Dinosaurs are
   awesome”?

Now let’s load and look at the data. The data file ``likert.omv``
contains a single variable that contains raw Likert-scale responses for
these 10 people. However, if you think about it, this isn’t the best way
to represent these responses. Because of the fairly symmetric way that
we set up the response scale, there’s a sense in which the midpoint of
the scale should have been coded as 0 (no opinion), and the two
endpoints should be **+3** (strongly agree) and **-3** (strongly
disagree). By recoding the data in this way it’s a bit more reflective
of how we really think about the responses. The recoding here is pretty
straightforward, we just subtract 4 from the raw scores. In jamovi you
can do this by computing a new variable: click on the ``Compute`` button
in the ``Data`` tab and you will see that a new variable has been added to the
spreadsheet. Let’s call this new variable ``likert.centred`` (go ahead
and type that in) and then add the following in the formula box, like in
:numref:`fig-likertraw`: ``likert.raw - 4``

.. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

One reason why it might be useful to have the data in this format is
that there are a lot of situations where you might prefer to analyse the
*strength* of the opinion separately from the *direction* of the
opinion. We can do two different transformations on this
``likert.centred`` variable in order to distinguish between these two
different concepts. First, to compute an ``opinion.strength`` variable,
we want to take the absolute value of the centred data (using the ``ABS``
function).\ [#]_ In jamovi, create another new variable using the
``Compute`` button. Name the variable ``opinion.strength`` and this time
click on the *f*\ :sub:`x` button next to the ``Formula`` box. This shows the
different ``Functions`` and ``Variables`` that you can add to the ``Formula``
box, so double click on ``ABS`` and then double click on ``likert.centred``
and you will see that the ``Formula`` box is populated with
``ABS(likert.centred)`` and a new variable has been created in the
spreadsheet view, as in :numref:`fig-opinionstrength`:

.. figure:: ../_images/lsj_opinionstrength.*

.. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Second, to compute a variable that contains only the direction of the
opinion and ignores the strength, we want to calculate the ‘sign’ of the
variable. In jamovi we can use the ``IF`` function to do this. Create
another new variable using the ``Compute`` button, name this one
``opinion.sign``, and then type the following into the function box:

``IF(likert.centred == 0, 0, likert.centred / opinion.strength)``

When done, you’ll see that all negative numbers from the
``likert.centred`` variable are converted to **-1**, all positive
numbers are converted to **1** and zero stays as **0**, like so:

.. code-block:: rout

   -1  1 -1  0  0  0 -1  1  1  1

Let’s break down what this ``IF`` command is doing. In jamovi there are
three parts to an ``IF`` statement, written as ``IF(expression, value,
else)``. The first part, ‘expression’ can be a logical or mathematical
statement. In our example, we have specified ``likert.centred == 0``,
which is ``TRUE`` for values where ``likert.centred`` is zero. The next part,
``value``, is the new value where the expression in part one is ``TRUE``. In
our example, we have said that for all those values where ``likert.centred``
is zero, keep them zero. In the next part, ``else``, we can enter another
logical or mathematical statement to be used if part one evaluates to
``FALSE``, i.e. where ``likert.centred`` is not zero. In our example we have
divided ``likert.centred`` by opinion.strength to give ``-1`` or ``+1``
depending of the sign of the original value in likert.centred.\ [#]_

And we’re done. We now have three shiny new variables, all of which are
useful transformations of the original ``likert.raw`` data.

Collapsing a variable into a smaller number of discrete levels or categories
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One pragmatic task that comes up quite often is the problem of
collapsing a variable into a smaller number of discrete levels or
categories. For instance, suppose I’m interested in looking at the age
distribution of people at a social gathering:

.. code-block:: rout

   60, 58, 24, 26, 34, 42, 31, 30, 33, 2, 9

In some situations it can be quite helpful to group these into a
smallish number of categories. For example, we could group the data into
three broad categories: young (0-20), adult (21-40) and older (41-60).
This is a quite coarse-grained classification, and the labels that I’ve
attached only make sense in the context of this data set (e.g., viewed
more generally, a 42 year old wouldn’t consider themselves as “older”).
We can slice this variable up quite easily using the jamovi ``IF’
function that we have already used. This time we have to specify nested
‘IF`` statements, meaning simply that IF the first logical expression is
TRUE, insert a first value, but IF a second logical expression is TRUE,
insert a second value, but IF a third logical expression is TRUE, then
insert a third value. This can be written as:

.. code-block:: rout

IF(Age >= 0 and Age <= 20, 1, IF(Age >= 21 and Age <= 40, 2, IF(Age >= 41 and Age <= 60, 3 )))

Note that there are three left parentheses used during the nesting, so
the whole statement has to end with three right parentheses otherwise
you will get an error message. The jamovi screen shot for this data
manipulation, along with an accompanying frequency table, is shown in
:numref:`fig-agecats`:

   :alt: Using the ``IF`` function

   jamovi ``IF`` function
   
.. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

It’s important to take the time to figure out whether or not the
resulting categories make any sense at all in terms of your research
project. If they don’t make any sense to you as meaningful categories,
then any data analysis that uses those categories is likely to be just
as meaningless. More generally, in practice I’ve noticed that people
have a very strong desire to carve their (continuous and messy) data
into a few (discrete and simple) categories, and then run analyses using
the categorised data instead of the original data.\ [#]_ I wouldn’t go so
far as to say that this is an inherently bad idea, but it does have some
fairly serious drawbacks at times, so I would advise some caution if you
are thinking about doing it.

Creating a transformation that can be applied to multiple variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes you want to apply the same transformation to more than one
variable, for example when you have multiple questionnaire items that
all need to be recalculated or recoded in the same way. And one of the
neat features in jamovi is that you can create a transformation, using
the ``Transform`` button in the ``Data`` tab, that can then be saved and
applied to multiple variables. Let’s go back to the first example above, using
the data file ``likert.omv`` that contains a single variable with raw
Likert-scale responses for 10 people. To create a transformation that
you can save and then apply across multiple variables (assuming you had
more variables like this in your data file), first in the spreadsheet
editor select (i.e., click) the variable you want to use to initially
create the transformation. In our example this is ``likert.raw``. Next
click the ``Transform`` button in the jamovi ``Data`` tab, and you’ll see
something like :numref:`fig-transform1`.

.. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. _fig-transform1:
.. figure:: ../_images/lsj_transform1.*
   :alt: Using the jamovi ``Transform`` command

   Creating a new variable transformation using the jamovi ``Transform``
   command
   
.. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Give your new variable a name, let’s call it ``opinion.strength`` and
then click on the ``Using transform`` selection box and select ``Create New
Transform...``. This is where you will create, and name, the
transformation that can be re-applied to as many variables as you like.
The transformation is automatically named for us as ``Transform 1``
(imaginative, huh. You can change this if you like). Then type the
expression ``ABS($source - 4)`` into the function text box, as in
:numref:`fig-transform2`, press Enter or Return on your keyboard and, hey
presto, you have created a new transformation and applied it to the
``likert.raw`` variable! Good, eh. Note that instead of using the variable
label in the expression, we have instead used ``$source``. This is so that
we can then use the same transformation with as many different variables as we
like - jamovi requires you to use ``$source`` to refer to the source variable
you are transforming. Your transformation has also been saved and can be
re-used any time you like (providing you save the dataset as an ``.omv`` file,
otherwise you’ll lose it!).

   :alt: Specifying a transformation in jamovi

   named ``Transform 1``
      
.. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can also create a transformation with the second example we looked at, the
age distribution of people at a social gathering. Go on, you know you want to!
Remember that we collapsed this variable into three groups: younger, adult and
older. This time we will achieve the same thing, but using the jamovi 
``Transform`` → ``Add condition`` button. With this data set (go back to it or
create it again if you didn’t save it) set up a new variable transformation.
Call the transformed variable ``AgeCats`` and the transformation you will
create ``Agegroupings``. Then click on the big ``+`` sign next to the function
box. This is the ``Add condition`` button and I’ve stuck a big red arrow onto
:numref:`fig-transform3` so you can see exactly where this is. Re-create the
transformation shown in :numref:`fig-transform3` and when you have done, you
will see the new values appear in the spreadsheet window. What’s more, the
``Agegroupings`` transformation has been saved and can be re-applied any time
you like. Ok, so I know that it’s unlikely you will have more than one ``Age``
variable, but you get the idea now of how to set up transformations in jamovi,
so you can follow this idea with other sorts of variables. A typical scenario
for this is when you have a questionnaire scale with, say, 20 items (variables)
and each item was originally scored from 1 to 6 but, for some reason or quirk
of the data you decide to recode all the items as 1 to 3. You can easily do
this in jamovi by creating and then re-applying your transformation for each
variable that you want to recode.

.. [#]
   The absolute value of a number is its distance from zero, regardless
   of whether it’s sign is negative or positive.

.. [#]
   The reason we have to use the ``IF`` command and keep zero as zero is
   that you cannot just use likert.centred / opinion.strength to
   calculate the sign of likert.centred, because mathematically dividing
   zero by zero does not work. Try it and see

.. [#]
   If you’ve read further into the book, and are re-reading this
   section, then a good example of this would be someone choosing to do
   an ANOVA using ``AgeCats`` as the grouping variable, instead of
   running a regression using ``Age`` as a predictor. There are
   sometimes good reasons for doing this. For instance, if the
   relationship between ``Age`` and your outcome variable is highly
   non-linear and you aren’t comfortable with trying to run non-linear
   regression! However, unless you really do have a good rationale for
   doing this, it’s best not to. It tends to introduce all sorts of
   other problems (e.g., the data will probably violate the normality
   assumption) and you can lose a lot of statistical power.
