"An important type of statistical inference problem discussed in this book"
" is the comparison between two means, discussed in some detail in the "
"chapter on *t*-tests (Chapter `Comparing two means <Ch11_tTest.html"
"#comparing-two-means>`__). If you can remember back that far, you’ll "
"recall that there are several versions of the *t*-test. I’ll talk a "
"little about Bayesian versions of the independent samples *t*-tests and "
"the paired samples *t*-test in this section."

"The most common type of *t*-test is the independent samples *t*-test, and"
" it arises when you have data as in the ``harpo`` dataset that we used in"
" the earlier chapter on *t*-tests (Chapter `Comparing two means "
"<Ch11_tTest.html#comparing-two-means>`__). In this data set, we have two "
"groups of students, those who received lessons from Anastasia and those "
"who took their classes with Bernadette. The question we want to answer is"
" whether there’s any difference in the grades received by these two "
"groups of students. Back in that chapter, I suggested you could analyse "
"this kind of data using the Independent Samples *t*-test in jamovi, which"
" gave us the results in :numref:`fig-bayes1`. As we obtain a *p*-value "
"less than \\0.05, we reject the null hypothesis."

"What does the Bayesian version of the *t*-test look like? We can get the "
"Bayes factor analysis by selecting the ‘Bayes factor’ checkbox under the "
"‘Tests’ option, and accepting the suggested default value for the "
"‘Prior’. This gives the results shown in the table in :numref:`fig-"
"bayes2`. What we get in this table is a Bayes factor statistic of 1.75, "
"meaning that the evidence provided by these data are about 1.8:1 in "
"favour of the alternative hypothesis."

"Before moving on, it’s worth highlighting the difference between the "
"orthodox test results and the Bayesian one. According to the orthodox "
"test, we obtained a significant result, though only barely. Nevertheless,"
" many people would happily accept *p* = 0.043 as reasonably strong "
"evidence for an effect. In contrast, notice that the Bayesian test "
"doesn’t even reach 2:1 odds in favour of an effect, and would be "
"considered very weak evidence at best. In my experience that’s a pretty "
"typical outcome. Bayesian methods usually require more evidence before "
"rejecting the null."

"Back in Section `The paired-samples t-test <Ch11_tTest_05.html#the-"
"paired-samples-t-test>`__ I discussed the ``chico.csv`` data set in which"
" student grades were measured on two tests, and we were interested in "
"finding out whether grades went up from test 1 to test 2. Because every "
"student did both tests, the tool we used to analyse the data was a paired"
" samples *t*-test. :numref:`fig-bayes3` shows the jamovi results table "
"for the conventional paired *t*-test alongside the Bayes factor analysis."
" At this point, I hope you can read this output without any difficulty. "
"The data provide evidence of about 6000:1 in favour of the alternative. "
"We could probably reject the null with some confidence!"

"The format of this is pretty familiar. At the bottom we have some "
"techical rubbish, and at the top we have some information about the Bayes"
" factors. What’s new is the fact that we seem to have *lots* of Bayes "
"factors here. What’s all this about?"

"The trick to understanding this output is to recognise that if we’re "
"interested in working out which of the 3 predictor variables are related "
"to ``dan.grump``, there are actually 8 possible regression models that "
"could be considered. One possibility is the *intercept only model*, in "
"which none of the three variables have an effect. At the other end of the"
" spectrum is the *full model* in which all three variables matter. So "
"what ``regressionBF()`` does is treat the *intercept only* model as the "
"null hypothesis, and print out the Bayes factors for all other models "
"when compared against that null. For example, if we look at line 4 in the"
" table, we see that the evidence is about 10\\ :sup:`33` to 1 in favour "
"of the claim that a model that includes both ``dan.sleep`` and ``day`` is"
" better than the intercept only model. Or if we look at line 1, we can "
"see that the odds are about 1.6 · 10\\ :sup:`34` that a model containing "
"the ``dan.sleep`` variable (but no others) is better than the intercept "
"only model."
