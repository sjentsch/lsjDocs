Summary
-------

Null hypothesis testing is one of the most ubiquitous elements to statistical
theory. The vast majority of scientific papers report the results of some
hypothesis test or another. As a consequence it is almost impossible to get by
in science without having at least a cursory understanding of what a *p*-value
means, making this one of the most important chapters in the book. As usual,
I will end the chapter with a quick recapitulation of the key ideas that we have
talked about:

-  :doc:`Research hypotheses and statistical hypotheses, Null and alternative
   hypotheses <Ch09_HypothesisTesting_01>`

-  :doc:`Type I and Type II errors <Ch09_HypothesisTesting_02>`

-  :doc:`Ch09_HypothesisTesting_03`

-  :doc:`Hypothesis testing as a decision making process
   <Ch09_HypothesisTesting_04>`

-  :doc:`*p*-values as “soft” decisions <Ch09_HypothesisTesting_05>`

-  :doc:`Writing up the results of a hypothesis test
   <Ch09_HypothesisTesting_06>`

-  :doc:`Ch09_HypothesisTesting_07`

-  :doc:`Ch09_HypothesisTesting_08`

-  :doc:`Some issues to consider regarding hypothesis testing
   <Ch09_HypothesisTesting_09>`

Later in the book, in chapter :doc:`../Ch16/Ch16_Bayes`, I will revisit the
theory of null hypothesis tests from a Bayesian perspective and introduce a
number of new tools that you can use if you are not particularly fond of the
orthodox approach. But for now, though, we are done with the abstract
statistical theory, and we can start discussing specific data analysis tools.
