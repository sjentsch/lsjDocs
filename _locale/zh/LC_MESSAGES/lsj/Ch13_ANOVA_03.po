"I’m pretty sure I know what you’re thinking after reading the last "
"section, *especially* if you followed my advice and did all of that by "
"pencil and paper (i.e., in a spreadsheet) yourself. Doing the ANOVA "
"calculations yourself *sucks*. There’s quite a lot of calculations that "
"we needed to do along the way, and it would be tedious to have to do this"
" over and over again every time you wanted to do an ANOVA."

"To make life easier for you, jamovi can do ANOVA..hurrah! Go to the "
"``ANOVA`` - ``ANOVA`` analysis, and move the ``mood.gain`` variable "
"across so it is in the ``Dependent Variable`` box, and then move the "
"``drug`` variable across so it is in the ``Fixed Factors`` box. This "
"should give the results as shown in :numref:`fig-anova2`.\\ [#]_ Note I "
"have also checked the η² checkbox, pronounced “eta” squared, under the "
"``Effect Size`` option and this is also shown on the results table. We "
"will come back to effect sizes a bit later."

"The jamovi results table shows you the sums of squares values, the "
"degrees of freedom, and a couple of other quantities that we’re not "
"really interested in right now. Notice, however, that jamovi doesn’t use "
"the names “between-group” and “within-group”. Instead, it tries to assign"
" more meaningful names. In our particular example, the *between groups* "
"variance corresponds to the effect that the ``drug`` has on the outcome "
"variable, and the *within groups* variance corresponds to the “leftover” "
"variability so it calls that the *residuals*. If we compare these numbers"
" to the numbers that I calculated by hand in Section `A worked example "
"<Ch13_ANOVA_02.html#a-worked-example>`__, you can see that they’re more "
"or less the same, apart from rounding errors. The between groups sums of "
"squares is SS\\ :sub:`b` = 3.45, the within groups sums of squares is "
"SS\\ :sub:`w` = 1.39, and the degrees of freedom are 2 and 15 "
"respectively. We also get the *F*-value and the *p*-value and, again, "
"these are more or less the same, give or take rounding errors, to the "
"numbers that we calculated ourselves when doing it the long and tedious "
"way."
