"Up to this point in the book we’ve discussed some of the key ideas in "
"experimental design, and we’ve talked a little about how you can "
"summarise a data set. To a lot of people this is all there is to "
"statistics: collecting all the numbers, calculating averages, drawing "
"pictures, and putting them all in a report somewhere. Kind of like stamp "
"collecting but with numbers. However, statistics covers much more than "
"that. In fact, descriptive statistics is one of the smallest parts of "
"statistics and one of the least powerful. The bigger and more useful part"
" of statistics is that it provides information that lets you make "
"inferences about data."

"Once you start thinking about statistics in these terms, that statistics "
"is there to help us draw inferences from data, you start seeing examples "
"of it everywhere. For instance, here’s a tiny extract from a newspaper "
"article in the Sydney Morning Herald (30 Oct 2010):"

"“I have a tough job,” the Premier said in response to a poll which found "
"her government is now the most unpopular Labor administration in polling "
"history, with a primary vote of just 23 per cent."

"This kind of remark is entirely unremarkable in the papers or in everyday"
" life, but let’s have a think about what it entails. A polling company "
"has conducted a survey, usually a pretty big one because they can afford "
"it. I’m too lazy to track down the original survey so let’s just imagine "
"that they called 1000 New South Wales (NSW) voters at random, and 230 "
"(23%) of those claimed that they intended to vote for the Australian "
"Labor Party (ALP). For the 2010 Federal election the Australian Electoral"
" Commission reported 4,610,795 enrolled voters in NSW, so the opinions of"
" the remaining 4,609,795 voters (about 99.98% of voters) remain unknown "
"to us. Even assuming that no-one lied to the polling company the only "
"thing we can say with 100% confidence is that the true ALP primary vote "
"is somewhere between 230/4610795 (about \\0.005%) and 4610025/4610795 "
"(about 99.83%). So, on what basis is it legitimate for the polling "
"company, the newspaper, and the readership to conclude that the ALP "
"primary vote is only about 23%?"

"The answer to the question is pretty obvious. If I call 1000 people at "
"random, and 230 of them say they intend to vote for the ALP, then it "
"seems very unlikely that these are the *only* 230 people out of the "
"entire voting public who actually intend to vote ALP. In other words, we "
"assume that the data collected by the polling company is pretty "
"representative of the population at large. But how representative? Would "
"we be surprised to discover that the true ALP primary vote is actually "
"24%? 29%? 37%? At this point everyday intuition starts to break down a "
"bit. No-one would be surprised by 24%, and everybody would be surprised "
"by 37%, but it’s a bit hard to say whether 29% is plausible. We need some"
" more powerful tools than just looking at the numbers and guessing."

"**Inferential statistics** provides the tools that we need to answer "
"these sorts of questions, and since these kinds of questions lie at the "
"heart of the scientific enterprise, they take up the lions share of every"
" introductory course on statistics and research methods. However, the "
"theory of statistical inference is built on top of **probability "
"theory**. And it is to probability theory that we must now turn. This "
"discussion of probability theory is basically background detail. There’s "
"not a lot of statistics per se in this chapter, and you don’t need to "
"understand this material in as much depth as the other chapters in this "
"part of the book. Nevertheless, because probability theory does underpin "
"so much of statistics, it’s worth covering some of the basics."
