Summary
-------

The key ideas discussed in this chapter are:

-  `The χ² (chi-square) goodness-of-fit test
   <Ch10_ChiSquare_1.html#the-2-chi-square-goodness-of-fit-test>`__ is used
   when you have a table of observed frequencies of different categories, and
   the null hypothesis gives you a set of “known” probabilities to compare them
   to.

-  `The χ² (chi-square) test of independence
   <Ch10_ChiSquare_2.html#the-2-chi-square-test-of-independence-or-association>`__
   is used when you have a contingency table (cross-tabulation) of two
   categorical variables. The null hypothesis is that there is no relationship
   or association between the variables.

-  `Effect size <Ch10_ChiSquare_4.html#effect-size>`__ for a contingency table
   can be measured in several ways. In particular we noted the Cramér’s *V*
   statistic.

-  Both versions of the Pearson test rely on two `assumptions
   <Ch10_ChiSquare_5.html#assumptions-of-the-test-s>`__: that the expected
   frequencies are sufficiently large, and that the observations are
   independent. The `Fisher exact test
   <Ch10_ChiSquare_6.html#the-fisher-exact-test>`__ can be used when the
   expected frequencies are small. The `McNemar test
   <Ch10_ChiSquare_7.html#the-mcnemar-test>`__ can be used for some kinds of
   violations of independence.

If you’re interested in learning more about categorical data analysis a
good first choice would be `Agresti (2018) <References.html#agresti-2018>`__
which, as the title suggests, provides an *Introduction to Categorical Data
Analysis*. If the introductory book isn’t enough for you (or can’t solve
the problem you’re working on) you could consider `Agresti (2012)
<References.html#agresti-2012>`__, *Categorical Data Analysis*. The
latter is a more advanced text, so it’s probably not wise to jump
straight from this book to that one.
