"A very common task when analysing data is the construction of frequency "
"tables, or cross-tabulation of one variable against another. These tasks "

"Let’s start with a simple example. As a parent of a small child I "
"naturally spend a lot of time watching TV shows like *In the Night "
"Garden*. In the ``nightgarden.csv`` file, I’ve transcribed a short "
"section of the dialogue. The file contains two variables of interest, "
"``speaker`` and ``utterance``. Open up this data set in jamovi and take a"
" look at the data in the ``Data`` view. You will see that the data looks "
"something like this:"

"Looking at this it becomes very clear what happened to my sanity! With "
"these as my data, one task I might find myself needing to do is construct"
" a frequency count of the number of words each character speaks during "
"the show. The jamovi ``Descriptives`` screen has a check box called "
"``Frequency tables`` which does just this, see :numref:`fig-freqtable`."

"The output here tells us on the first line that what we’re looking at is "
"a tabulation of the ``speaker`` variable. In the ``Levels`` column it "
"lists all the different speakers that exist in the data, and in the "
"``Counts`` column it tells you how many times that speaker appears in the"
" data. In other words, it’s a frequency table."

"In jamovi, the ``Frequency tables`` check box will only produce a table "
"for single variables. For a table of two variables, for example combining"
" ``speaker`` and ``utterance`` so that we can see how many times each "
"speaker said a particular utterance, we need a cross-tabulation or "
"contingency table. In jamovi you can do this by selecting the "
"``Frequencies`` → ``Contingency Tables`` → ``Independent Samples`` "
"analysis, and moving the ``speaker`` variable into the ``Rows`` box, and "
"the ``utterances`` variable into the ``Columns`` box. You then should "
"have a contingency table like the one shown in :numref:`fig-"
"contingencytable`."

"Don’t worry about the “χ² Tests” table that is produced. We are going to "
"cover this later on in chapter `Categorical data analysis "
"<Ch10_ChiSquare.html#categorical-data-analysis>`__. When interpreting the"
" contingency table remember that these are counts, so the fact that the "
"first row and second column of numbers corresponds to a value of 2 "
"indicates that ``makka-pakka`` (row 1) says ``onk`` (column 2) twice in "
"this data set."

"The contingency table shown in :numref:`fig-contingencytable` shows a "
"table of raw frequencies. That is, a count of the total number of cases "
"for different combinations of levels of the specified variables. However,"
" often you want your data to be organised in terms of percentages as well"
" as counts. You can find the check boxes for different percentages under "
"the ``Cells`` option in the ``Contingency Tables`` window. First, click "
"on the ``Row`` check box and the Contingency Table in the output window "
"will change to the one in :numref:`fig-contingencyrow`."

"What we’re looking at here is the percentage of utterances made by each "
"character. In other words, 50% of ``makka-pakka``’s utterances are "
"``pip``, and the other 50% are ``onk``. Let’s contrast this with the "
"table we get when we calculate column percentages (uncheck ``Row`` and "
"check ``Column`` in the ``Cells`` options window), see :numref:`fig-"
"contingencycol`. In this version, what we’re seeing is the percentage of "
"characters associated with each utterance. For instance, whenever the "
"utterance ``ee`` is made (in this data set), 100% of the time it’s a "
"Tombliboo saying it."
