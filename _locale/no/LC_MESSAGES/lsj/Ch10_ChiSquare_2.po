"The other day I was watching an animated documentary examining the quaint"
" customs of the natives of the planet *Chapek 9*. Apparently, in order to"
" gain access to their capital city a visitor must prove that they’re a "
"robot, not a human. In order to determine whether or not a visitor is "
"human, the natives ask whether the visitor prefers puppies, flowers, or "
"large, properly formatted data files. “Pretty clever,” I thought to "
"myself “but what if humans and robots have the same preferences? That "
"probably wouldn’t be a very good test then, would it?” As it happens, I "
"got my hands on the testing data that the civil authorities of *Chapek 9*"
" used to check this. It turns out that what they did was very simple. "
"They found a bunch of robots and a bunch of humans and asked them what "
"they preferred. I saved their data in a file called ``chapek9.omv``, "
"which we can now load into jamovi. As well as the ``ID`` variable that "
"identifies individual people, there are two nominal text variables, "
"``species`` and ``choice``. In total there are 180 entries in the data "
"set, one for each person (counting both robots and humans as “people”) "
"who was asked to make a choice. Specifically, there are 93 humans and 87 "
"robots, and overwhelmingly the preferred choice is the data file. You can"
" check this yourself by asking jamovi for Frequency Tables, under the "
"‘Exploration’ - ‘Descriptives’ button. However, this summary does not "
"address the question we’re interested in. To do that, we need a more "
"detailed description of the data. What we want to do is look at the "
"``choices`` broken down *by* ``species``. That is, we need to cross-"
"tabulate the data (see `Tabulating and cross-tabulating data "
"<Ch06_DataHandling_1.html#tabulating-and-cross-tabulating-data>`__). In "
"jamovi we do this using the ``Frequencies`` → ``Contingency Tables`` → "
