"`The χ² (chi-square) goodness-of-fit test <Ch10_ChiSquare_1.html#the-2"
"-chi-square-goodness-of-fit-test>`__ is used when you have a table of "
"observed frequencies of different categories, and the null hypothesis "
"gives you a set of “known” probabilities to compare them to."

msgid ""
"`The χ² (chi-square) test of independence <Ch10_ChiSquare_2.html#the-2"
"-chi-square-test-of-independence-or-association>`__ is used when you have"
" a contingency table (cross-tabulation) of two categorical variables. The"
" null hypothesis is that there is no relationship or association between "
"the variables."

"`Effect size <Ch10_ChiSquare_4.html#effect-size>`__ for a contingency "
"table can be measured in several ways. In particular we noted the "
"Cramér’s *V* statistic."

"Both versions of the Pearson test rely on two `assumptions "
"<Ch10_ChiSquare_5.html#assumptions-of-the-test-s>`__: that the expected "
"frequencies are sufficiently large, and that the observations are "
"independent. The `Fisher exact test <Ch10_ChiSquare_6.html#the-fisher-"
"exact-test>`__ can be used when the expected frequencies are small. The "
"`McNemar test <Ch10_ChiSquare_7.html#the-mcnemar-test>`__ can be used for"
" some kinds of violations of independence."

"If you’re interested in learning more about categorical data analysis a "
"good first choice would be `Agresti (2018) "
"<References.html#agresti-2018>`__ which, as the title suggests, provides "
"an *Introduction to Categorical Data Analysis*. If the introductory book "
"isn’t enough for you (or can’t solve the problem you’re working on) you "
"could consider `Agresti (2012) <References.html#agresti-2012>`__, "
"*Categorical Data Analysis*. The latter is a more advanced text, so it’s "
"probably not wise to jump straight from this book to that one."
