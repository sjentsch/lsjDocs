"In this chapter, we’re going to start thinking about the basic ideas that"
" go into designing a study, collecting data, checking whether your data "
"collection works, and so on. It won’t give you enough information to "
"allow you to design studies of your own, but it will give you a lot of "
"the basic tools that you need to assess the studies done by other people."
" However, since the focus of this book is much more on data analysis than"
" on data collection, I’m only giving a very brief overview. Note that "
"this chapter is “special” in two ways. Firstly, it’s much more "
"psychology-specific than the later chapters. Secondly, it focuses much "
"more heavily on the scientific problem of research methodology, and much "
"less on the statistical problem of data analysis. Nevertheless, the two "
"problems are related to one another, so it’s traditional for stats "
"textbooks to discuss the problem in a little detail. This chapter relies "
"heavily on `Campbell and Stanley (1963) "
"<References.html#campbell-1963>`__ for the discussion of study design, "
"and `Stevens (1946) <References.html#stevens-1946>`__ for the discussion "
"of scales of measurement."
