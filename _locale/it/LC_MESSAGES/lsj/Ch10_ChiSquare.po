"Now that we’ve covered the basic theory behind hypothesis testing it’s "
"time to start looking at specific tests that are commonly used in "
"psychology. So where should we start? Not every textbook agrees on where "
"to start, but I’m going to start with “χ² tests” (this chapter, "
"pronounced “chi-square” [#]_) and “*t*-tests” (Chapter `Comparing two "
"means <Ch11_tTest.html#comparing-two-means>`__). Both of these tools are "
"very frequently used in scientific practice, and whilst they’re not as "
"powerful as “regression” (see Chapter `Correlation and linear regression "
"<Ch12_Regression.html#correlation-and-linear-regression>`__) and "
"“Analysis of Variance” (Chapter `Comparing several means (one-way ANOVA) "
"<Ch13_ANOVA.html#comparing-several-means-one-way-anova>`__) they’re much "
"easier to understand."

"The term “categorical data” is just another name for “nominal scale "
"data”. It’s nothing that we haven’t already discussed, it’s just that in "
"the context of data analysis people tend to use the term “categorical "
"data” rather than “nominal scale data”. I don’t know why. In any case, "
"**categorical data analysis** refers to a collection of tools that you "
"can use when your data are nominal scale. However, there are a lot of "
"different tools that can be used for categorical data analysis, and this "
"chapter covers only a few of the more common ones."
