"At the start of the last chapter I highlighted the critical distinction "
"between *descriptive statistics* and *inferential statistics*. As "
"discussed in `Descriptive statistics <Ch04_Descriptives.html#descriptive-"
"statistics>`__, the role of descriptive statistics is to concisely "
"summarise what we *do* know. In contrast, the purpose of inferential "
"statistics is to “learn what we do not know from what we do”. Now that we"
" have a foundation in probability theory we are in a good position to "
"think about the problem of statistical inference. What kinds of things "
"would we like to learn about? And how do we learn them? These are the "
"questions that lie at the heart of inferential statistics, and they are "
"traditionally divided into two “big ideas”: estimation and hypothesis "
"testing. The goal in this chapter is to introduce the first of these big "
"ideas, estimation theory, but I’m going to witter on about sampling "
"theory first because estimation theory doesn’t make sense until you "
"understand sampling. As a consequence, this chapter divides naturally "
"into two parts `Samples, populations and sampling <Ch08_Estimation_1.html"
"#samples-populations-and-sampling>`__ through `Sampling distributions and"
" the central limit theorem <Ch08_Estimation_3.html#sampling-"
"distributions-and-the-central-limit-theorem>`__ are focused on sampling "
"theory, and `Estimating means and standard deviations "
"<Ch08_Estimation_4.html#estimating-population-parameters>`__ and "
"`Estimating a confidence interval <Ch08_Estimation_5.html#estimating-a"
"-confidence-interval>`__ make use of sampling theory to discuss how "
"statisticians think about estimation."
