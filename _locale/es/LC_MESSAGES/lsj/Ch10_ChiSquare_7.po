"Suppose you’ve been hired to work for the *Australian Generic Political "
"Party* (AGPP), and part of your job is to find out how effective the AGPP"
" political advertisements are. So you decide to put together a sample of "
"N = 100 people and ask them to watch the AGPP ads. Before they see "
"anything, you ask them if they intend to vote for the AGPP, and then "
"after showing the ads you ask them again to see if anyone has changed "
"their minds. Obviously, if you’re any good at your job, you’d also do a "
"whole lot of other things too, but let’s consider just this one simple "

"At first pass, you might think that this situation lends itself to the "
"Pearson `χ² test of independence <Ch10_ChiSquare_2.html#the-2-chi-square-"
"test-of-independence-or-association>`__. However, a little bit of thought"
" reveals that we’ve got a problem. We have 100 participants but 200 "
"observations. This is because each person has provided us with an answer "
"in *both* the before column and the after column. What this means is that"
" the 200 observations aren’t independent of each other. If voter A says "
"“yes” the first time and voter B says “no”, then you’d expect that voter "
"A is more likely to say “yes” the second time than voter B! The "
"consequence of this is that the usual χ² test won’t give trustworthy "
"answers due to the violation of the independence assumption. Now, if this"
" were a really uncommon situation, I wouldn’t be bothering to waste your "
"time talking about it. But it’s not uncommon at all. This is a *standard*"
" repeated measures design, and none of the tests we’ve considered so far "
"can handle it. Eek."

"Next, let’s think about what our null hypothesis is: it’s that the "
"“before” test and the “after” test have the same proportion of people "
"saying “Yes, I will vote for AGPP”. Because of the way that we have "
"rewritten the data, it means that we’re now testing the hypothesis that "
"the *row totals* and *column totals* come from the same distribution. "
"Thus, the null hypothesis in McNemar’s test is that we have “marginal "
"homogeneity”. That is, the row totals and column totals have the same "
"distribution: *P*\\ :sub:`a` + *P*\\ :sub:`b` = *P*\\ :sub:`a` \\+ *P*\\ "
":sub:`c` and similarly that *P*\\ :sub:`c` + *P*\\ :sub:`d` = *P*\\ "
":sub:`b` + *P*\\ :sub:`d`\\. Notice that this means that the null "
"hypothesis actually simplifies to *P*\\ :sub:`b` = *P*\\ :sub:`c`\\. In "
"other words, as far as the McNemar test is concerned, it’s only the off-"
"diagonal entries in this table (i.e., *b* and *c*) that matter! After "
"noticing this, the **McNemar test of marginal homogeneity** is no "
"different to a usual χ² test. After applying the Yates correction, our "
"test statistic becomes:"

"Now that you know what the McNemar test is all about, lets actually run "
"one. The ``agpp`` dataset contains the raw data that I discussed "
"previously. It contains three variables, an ``id`` variable that labels "
"each participant in the dataset (we’ll see why that’s useful in a "
"moment), a ``response_before`` variable that records the person’s answer "
"when they were asked the question the first time, and a "
"``response_after`` variable that shows the answer that they gave when "
"asked the same question a second time. Notice that each participant "
"appears only once in this data set. Go to ``Analyses`` → ``Frequencies`` "
"→ ``Contingency Tables`` → ``Paired Samples`` in jamovi, and move "
"``response_before`` into the ``Rows`` box, and ``response_after`` into "
"the ``Columns`` box. You will then get a contingency table in the results"
