There is more to research methods than statistics
------------------------------------------------

So far, most of what I have talked about is statistics, and so you would be
forgiven for thinking that statistics is all I care about. To be
fair, you would not be far wrong, but research methodology is a broader
concept than statistics. So most research methods courses will cover
topics that relate much more to the pragmatics of research
design, and in particular the issues that you encounter when trying to
do research with humans. However, about 99\% of student *fears* relate to
the statistics part of the course, so I have focused on the stats in this
discussion, and hopefully I have convinced you that statistics matters,
and more importantly, should not be feared. That said, it is
typical for introductory research methods classes to be very
stats-heavy. Thit is not (usually) because the lecturers are evil
people. Quite the contrary, in fact. Introductory classes focus a lot on
the statistics because you almost always find yourself needing
statistics before you need other research methods training. Why?
Because almost all your assignments in other classes will rely on
statistical training, to a greater extent than they rely on other
methodological tools. It is not common for undergraduate assignments to
require you to design your own study from the ground up (in which case
you would need to know a lot about research design), but it *is* common
for assignments to ask you to analyse and interpret data that were
collected in a study that someone else designed (in which case you need
statistics). In that sense, from the perspective of enabling you to do
well in all your other classes, statistics is more urgent.

But note that “urgent” is different from “important” – they both matter.
I really do want to stress that research design is just as important as
data analysis, and this book does spend some time on it.
However, while statistics has a kind of universality, and provides a set
of core tools that are useful for most types of psychological research,
the research methods side is not quite so universal. There are some
general principles that everyone should think about, but a lot of
research design is very idiosyncratic, and is specific to the area of
research that you want to engage in. To the extent that it is the details
that matter, those details do not usually show up in an introductory
stats and research methods class.
