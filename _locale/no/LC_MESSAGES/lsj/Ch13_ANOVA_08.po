"The Friedman test is a non-parametric version of a repeated measures "
"ANOVA and can be used instead of the Kruskall-Wallis test when testing "
"for differences between three or more groups where the same participants "
"are in each group, or each participant is closely matched with "
"participants in other conditions. If the dependent variable is ordinal, "
"or if the assumption of normality is not met, then the Friedman test can "
"be used."

"As with the Kruskall-Wallis test, the underlying mathematics is "
"complicated, and won’t be presented here. For the purpose of this book, "
"it is sufficient to note that jamovi calculates the tie-corrected version"
" of the Friedman test, and in :numref:`fig-RManova6` there is an example "
"using the Broca’s Aphasia data we have already looked at."

"It’s pretty straightforward to run a Friedman test in jamovi. Just select"
" ``Analyses`` → ``ANOVA`` → ``Repeated Measures ANOVA (Non-parametric)``,"
" as in :numref:`fig-RManova6`. Then highlight and transfer the names of "
"the repeated measures variables you wish to compare (``Speech``, "
"``Conceptual``, ``Syntax``) into the ``Measures:`` text box. To produce "
"descriptive statistics (means and medians) for the three repeated "
"measures variables, click on the ``Descriptives`` button."

msgid ""
"The jamovi results show descriptive statistics, χ²-value, degrees of "
"freedom, and the *p*-value (:numref:`fig-RManova6`). Since the *p*-value "
"is less than the level conventionally used to determine significance (*p*"
" < 0.05), we can conclude that Broca’s Aphasics perform reasonably well "
"on speech production (median = 7.5) and language comprehension (median = "
"6.5) tasks. However, their performance was considerably worse on the "
"syntax task (median = 4.5), with a significant difference in post-hoc "
"tests between Speech and Syntax task performance."
