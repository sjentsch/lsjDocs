The undiscovered statistics
---------------------------

First, I am going to talk a bit about some of the content that I wish I would
had the chance to cram into this version of the book, just so that you can get
a sense of what other ideas are out there in the world of statistics. I think
this would be important even if this book were getting close to a final
product. One thing that students often fail to realise is that their
introductory statistics classes are just that, an introduction. If you want to
go out into the wider world and do real data analysis, you have to learn a
whole lot of new tools that extend the content of your undergraduate lectures
in all sorts of different ways. Do not assume that something can not be done
just because it was not covered in undergrad. Do not assume that something is
the right thing to do just because it *was* covered in an undergrad class. To
stop you from falling victim to that trap, I think it is useful to give a bit
of an overview of some of the other ideas out there.
