"The one-way repeated measures ANOVA test is a statistical method of "
"testing for significant differences between three or more groups where "
"the same participants are used in each group (or each participant is "
"closely matched with participants in other experimental groups). For this"
" reason, there should always be an equal number of scores (data points) "
"in each experimental group. This type of design and analysis can also be "
"called a ‘related ANOVA’ or a ‘within-subjects ANOVA’."

"The logic behind a repeated measures ANOVA is very similar to that of an "
"independent ANOVA (sometimes called a ‘between-subjects’ ANOVA). You’ll "
"remember that earlier we showed that in a between-subjects ANOVA total "
"variability is partitioned into between-groups variability (SS\\ "
":sub:`b`) and within-groups variability (SS\\ :sub:`w`), and after each "
"is divided by the respective degrees of freedom to give MS\\ :sub:`b` and"
" MS\\ :sub:`w` (see :numref:`tab-anovatable`) the *F*-ratio is calculated"

"In a repeated measures ANOVA, the *F*-ratio is calculated in a similar "
"way, but whereas in an independent ANOVA the within-group variability "
"(SS\\ :sub:`w`) is used as the basis for the MS\\ :sub:`w` denominator, "
"in a repeated measures ANOVA the SS\\ :sub:`w` is partioned into two "
"parts. As we are using the same subjects in each group, we can remove the"
" variability due to the individual differences between subjects (referred"
" to as SS\\ :sub:`subjects`) from the within-groups variability. We won’t"
" go into too much technical detail about how this is done, but "
"essentially each subject becomes a level of a factor called subjects. The"
" variability in this within-subjects factor is then calculated in the "
"same way as any between-subjects factor. And then we can subtract SS\\ "
":sub:`subjects` from SS\\ :sub:`w` to provide a smaller SS\\ :sub:`error`"
