"**Scatterplots** are a simple but effective tool for visualising the "
"relationship between *two* variables, like we saw with the figures in the"
" section on correlation (Section `Correlations "
"<Ch12_Regression_01.html#correlations>`__). It’s this latter application "
"that we usually have in mind when we use the term “scatterplot”. In this "
"kind of plot each observation corresponds to one dot. The horizontal "
"location of the dot plots the value of the observation on one variable, "
"and the vertical location displays its value on the other variable. In "
"many situations you don’t really have a clear opinions about what the "
"*causal* relationship is (e.g., does A cause B, or does B cause A, or "
"does some other variable C control both A and B). If that’s the case, it "
"doesn’t really matter which variable you plot on the x-axis and which one"
" you plot on the y-axis. However, in many situations you do have a pretty"
" strong idea which variable you think is most likely to be causal, or at "
"least you have some suspicions in that direction. If so, then it’s "
"conventional to plot the cause variable on the x-axis, and the effect "
"variable on the y-axis. With that in mind, let’s look at how to draw "
"scatterplots in jamovi, using the same ``parenthood`` data set that I "
"used when introducing correlations."

"Suppose my goal is to draw a scatterplot displaying the relationship "
"between the amount of sleep that I get (``dan.sleep``) and how grumpy I "
"am the next day (``dan.grump``). There are two different ways in which we"
" can use jamovi to get the plot that we’re after. The first way is to use"
" the ``Plot`` option under the ``Regression`` → ``Correlation Matrix`` "
"button, giving us the output shown in :numref:`fig-scatterplot1`. Note "
"that jamovi draws a line through the points, we’ll come onto this a bit "
"later in Section `What is a linear regression model? "
"<Ch12_Regression_03.html#what-is-a-linear-regression-model>`__. Plotting "
"a scatterplot in this way also allow you to specify ``Densities for "
"variables`` and this option adds a density curve showing how the data in "
"each variable is distributed."

"The second way do to it is to use one of the jamovi add-on modules. This "
"module is called ``scatr`` and you can install it by clicking on the "
"large ``+`` icon in the top right of the jamovi screen, opening the "
"jamovi library, scrolling down until you find ``scatr`` and clicking "
"``Install``. When you have done this, you will find a new ``Scatterplot``"
" command available under the ``Exploration`` button. This plot is a bit "
"different than the first way, see :numref:`fig-scatterplot2`, but the "
"important information is the same."

"Often you will want to look at the relationships between several "
"variables at once, using a **scatterplot matrix** (in jamovi via the "
"``Correlation Matrix`` - ``Plot`` command). Just add another variable, "
"for example ``baby.sleep`` to the list of variables to be correlated, and"
" jamovi will create a scatterplot matrix for you, just like the one in "
":numref:`fig-scatterplot3`."
