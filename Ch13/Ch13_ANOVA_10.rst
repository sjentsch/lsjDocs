Summary
-------

There is a fair bit covered in this chapter, but there is still a lot missing.
Most obviously, I have not discussed how to run an ANOVA when you are
interested in more than one grouping variable, but that will be discussed in
a lot of detail in chapter :doc:`../Ch14/Ch14_ANOVA2`. In terms of what we
have discussed, the key topics were:

-  The basic logic behind :doc:`how ANOVA works <Ch13_ANOVA_02>` and :doc:`how
   to run one in jamovi <Ch13_ANOVA_03>`.

-  How to compute an :doc:`effect size <Ch13_ANOVA_04>` for an ANOVA.

-  :doc:`Post-hoc analysis and corrections for multiple testing <Ch13_ANOVA_05>`.

-  The :doc:`assumptions made by the ANOVA <Ch13_ANOVA_06>`: How to check the
   homogeneity of variance assumption and what to do if it is violated; as well
   as how to check the normality assumption and what to do if it is violated.

-  :doc:`Repeated measures ANOVA <Ch13_ANOVA_07>` and its non-parametric
   equivalent, the :doc:`Friedman test <Ch13_ANOVA_08>`.

As with all of the chapters in this book, there are quite a few different
sources that I have relied upon, but the one stand-out text that I have been most
heavily influenced by is :ref:`Sahai and Ageel (2000) <Sahai_2000>`. It is not
a good book for beginners, but it is an excellent book for more advanced
readers who are interested in understanding the mathematics behind ANOVA.
