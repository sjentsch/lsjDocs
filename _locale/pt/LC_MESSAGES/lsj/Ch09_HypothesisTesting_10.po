"Null hypothesis testing is one of the most ubiquitous elements to "
"statistical theory. The vast majority of scientific papers report the "
"results of some hypothesis test or another. As a consequence it is almost"
" impossible to get by in science without having at least a cursory "
"understanding of what a *p*-value means, making this one of the most "
"important chapters in the book. As usual, I’ll end the chapter with a "
"quick recap of the key ideas that we’ve talked about:"

"tests from a Bayesian perspective and introduce a number of new tools "

"approach. But for now, though, we’re done with the abstract statistical "
"theory, and we can start discussing specific data analysis tools."
