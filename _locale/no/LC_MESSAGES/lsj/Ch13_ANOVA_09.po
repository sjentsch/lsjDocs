"There’s one last thing I want to point out before finishing. It’s "
"something that a lot of people find kind of surprising, but it’s worth "
"knowing about. An ANOVA with two groups is identical to the Student "
"*t*-test. No, really. It’s not just that they are similar, but they are "
"actually equivalent in every meaningful way. I won’t try to prove that "
"this is always true, but I will show you a single concrete demonstration."
" Suppose that, instead of running an ANOVA on our ``mood.gain ~ drug`` "
"model, let’s instead do it using ``therapy`` as the predictor. If we run "
"this ANOVA we get an *F*-statistic of F(1,16) = 1.71, and a *p*-value = "
"0.21. Since we only have two groups, I didn’t actually need to resort to "
"an ANOVA, I could have just decided to run a Student *t*-test. So let’s "
"see what happens when I do that: I get a *t*-statistic of t(16) = -1.3068"
" and a *p*-value = 0.21. Curiously, the *p*-values are identical. Once "
"again we obtain a value of *p* = 0.21. But what about the test statistic?"
" Having run a *t*-test instead of an ANOVA, we get a somewhat different "
"answer, namely t(16) = -1.3068. However, there is a fairly "
"straightforward relationship here. If we square the *t*-statistic then we"
" get the *F*-statistic from before: -1.3068² = 1.7077"
