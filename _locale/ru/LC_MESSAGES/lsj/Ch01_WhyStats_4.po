"I hope that the discussion above helped explain why science in general is"
" so focused on statistics. But I’m guessing that you have a lot more "
"questions about what role statistics plays in psychology, and "
"specifically why psychology classes always devote so many lectures to "
"stats. So here’s my attempt to answer a few of them..."

"To be perfectly honest, there’s a few different reasons, some of which "
"are better than others. The most important reason is that psychology is a"
" statistical science. What I mean by that is that the “things” that we "
"study are *people*. Real, complicated, gloriously messy, infuriatingly "
"perverse people. The “things” of physics include objects like electrons, "
"and while there are all sorts of complexities that arise in physics, "
"electrons don’t have minds of their own. They don’t have opinions, they "
"don’t differ from each other in weird and arbitrary ways, they don’t get "
"bored in the middle of an experiment, and they don’t get angry at the "
"experimenter and then deliberately try to sabotage the data set (not that"
" I’ve ever done that!). At a fundamental level psychology is harder than "
"physics.\\ [#]_"

"Basically, we teach statistics to you as psychologists because you need "
"to be better at stats than physicists. There’s actually a saying used "
"sometimes in physics, to the effect that “if your experiment needs "
"statistics, you should have done a better experiment\". They have the "
"luxury of being able to say that because their objects of study are "
"pathetically simple in comparison to the vast mess that confronts social "
"scientists. And it’s not just psychology. Most social sciences are "
"desperately reliant on statistics. Not because we’re bad experimenters, "
"but because we’ve picked a harder problem to solve. We teach you stats "
"because you really, really need it."

"To some extent, but not completely. It’s true that you don’t need to "
"become a fully trained statistician just to do psychology, but you do "
"need to reach a certain level of statistical competence. In my view, "
"there’s three reasons that every psychological researcher ought to be "
"able to do basic statistics:"

"Firstly, there’s the fundamental reason: statistics is deeply intertwined"
" with research design. If you want to be good at designing psychological "
"studies, you need to at the very least understand the basics of stats."
msgstr ""

#: ../../lsj/Ch01_WhyStats_4.rst:51
msgid ""
"Secondly, if you want to be good at the psychological side of the "
"research, then you need to be able to understand the psychological "
"literature, right? But almost every paper in the psychological literature"
" reports the results of statistical analyses. So if you really want to "
"understand the psychology, you need to be able to understand what other "
"people did with their data. And that means understanding a certain amount"
" of statistics."
msgstr ""

#: ../../lsj/Ch01_WhyStats_4.rst:59
msgid ""
"Thirdly, there’s a big practical problem with being dependent on other "
"people to do all your statistics: statistical analysis is *expensive*. If"
" you ever get bored and want to look up how much the Australian "
"government charges for university fees, you’ll notice something "
"interesting: statistics is designated as a “national priority” category, "
"and so the fees are much, much lower than for any other area of study. "
"This is because there’s a massive shortage of statisticians out there. "
"So, from your perspective as a psychological researcher, the laws of "
"supply and demand aren’t exactly on your side here! As a result, in "
"almost any real life situation where you want to do psychological "
"research, the cruel facts will be that you don’t have enough money to "
"afford a statistician. So the economics of the situation mean that you "
"have to be pretty self-sufficient."

"Note that a lot of these reasons generalise beyond researchers. If you "
"want to be a practicing psychologist and stay on top of the field, it "
"helps to be able to read the scientific literature, which relies pretty "
"heavily on statistics."

"Okay, now you’re just messing with me. Still, I think it should matter to"
" you too. Statistics should matter to you in the same way that statistics"
" should matter to *everyone*. We live in the 21st century, and data are "
"*everywhere*. Frankly, given the world in which we live these days, a "
"basic knowledge of statistics is pretty damn close to a survival tool! "
"Which is the topic of the next section."

"Which might explain why physics is just a teensy bit further advanced as "
"a science than we are."
