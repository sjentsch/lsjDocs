"In all the IQ examples in the previous sections we actually knew the "
"population parameters ahead of time. As every undergraduate gets taught "
"in their very first lecture on the measurement of intelligence, IQ scores"
" are *defined* to have mean 100 and standard deviation 15. However, this "
"is a bit of a lie. How do we know that IQ scores have a true population "
"mean of 100? Well, we know this because the people who designed the tests"
" have administered them to very large samples, and have then “rigged” the"
" scoring rules so that their sample has mean 100. That’s not a bad thing "
"of course, it’s an important part of designing a psychological "
"measurement. However, it’s important to keep in mind that this "
"theoretical mean of 100 only attaches to the population that the test "
"designers used to design the tests. Good test designers will actually go "
"to some lengths to provide “test norms” that can apply to lots of "
"different populations (e.g., different age groups, nationalities etc)."

"This is very handy, but of course almost every research project of "

"Pirie, a South Australian industrial town with a lead smelter. Perhaps "
"you decide that you want to compare IQ scores among people in Port Pirie "
"to a comparable sample in Whyalla, a South Australian industrial town "
"with a steel refinery.\\ [#]_ Regardless of which town you’re thinking "
"about, it doesn’t make a lot of sense simply to *assume* that the true "
"population mean IQ is 100. No-one has, to my knowledge, produced sensible"
" norming data that can automatically be applied to South Australian "
"industrial towns. We’re going to have to **estimate** the population "

"description of your data, whereas the estimate is a guess about the "
"population. With that in mind, statisticians often different notation to "

"then we would use :math:`\\hat\\mu` to refer to our estimate of the "
"population mean. In contrast, the sample mean is denoted :math:`\\bar{X}`"
" or sometimes *m*. However, in simple random samples the estimate of the "
"population mean is identical to the sample mean. If I observe a sample "
"mean of :math:`\\bar{X}` = 98.5 then my estimate of the population mean "
"is also :math:`\\hat\\mu` = 98.5. To help keep the notation clear, here’s"

"One final point. In practice, a lot of people tend to refer to "
":math:`\\hat{\\sigma}` (i.e., the formula where we divide by *N* - 1) as "
"the *sample* standard deviation. Technically, this is incorrect. The "
"*sample* standard deviation should be equal to *s* (i.e., the formula "

"estimated characteristic of the population. However, in almost every real"

"rather than *s*. This is the right number to report, of course. It’s just"

"“estimated population standard deviation”. It’s no big deal, and in "
"practice I do the same thing everyone else does. Nevertheless, I think "
"it’s important to keep the two *concepts* separate. It’s never a good "
