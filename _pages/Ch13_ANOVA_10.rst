Summary
-------

There’s a fair bit covered in this chapter, but there’s still a lot missing.
Most obviously, I haven’t discussed how to run an ANOVA when you are interested
in more than one grouping variable, but that will be discussed in a lot of
detail in Chapter `Factorial ANOVA <Ch14_ANOVA2.html#factorial-anova>`__. In
terms of what we have discussed, the key topics were:

-  The basic logic behind `how ANOVA works <Ch13_ANOVA_02.html#how-anova-works>`__ 
   and `how to run one in jamovi <Ch13_ANOVA_03.html#running-an-anova-in-jamovi>`__.

-  How to compute an `effect size <Ch13_ANOVA_04.html#effect-size>`__ for an
   ANOVA.

-  `Post-hoc analysis and corrections for multiple testing
   <Ch13_ANOVA_05.html#multiple-comparisons-and-post-hoc-tests>`__

-  The `assumptions made by the ANOVA
   <Ch13_ANOVA_06.html#assumptions-of-the-one-way-anova>`__: `How to check
   the homogeneity of variance assumption
   <Ch13_ANOVA_06.html#checking-the-homogeneity-of-variance-assumption>`__ and
   `what to do if it is violated 
   <Ch13_ANOVA_06.html#removing-the-homogeneity-of-variance-assumption>`__; as
   well as `how to check the normality assumption
   <Ch13_ANOVA_06.html#checking-the-normality-assumption>`__  and `what to do if
   it is violated <Ch13_ANOVA_06.html#removing-the-normality-assumption>`__.

-  `Repeated measures ANOVA
   <Ch13_ANOVA_07.html#repeated-measures-one-way-anova>`__ and its
   non-parametric equivalent, the `Friedman test
   <Ch13_ANOVA_08.html#the-friedman-non-parametric-repeated-measures-anova-test>`__.

As with all of the chapters in this book, there are quite a few
different sources that I’ve relied upon, but the one stand-out text that
I’ve been most heavily influenced by is `Sahai and Ageel (2000)
<References.html#sahai-2000>`__. It’s not a good book for beginners,
but it’s an excellent book for more advanced readers who are interested
in understanding the mathematics behind ANOVA.
