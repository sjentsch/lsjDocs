"There are two more descriptive statistics that you will sometimes see "
"reported in the psychological literature: skew and kurtosis. In practice,"
" neither one is used anywhere near as frequently as the measures of "
"central tendency and variability that we’ve been talking about. Skew is "
"pretty important, so you do see it mentioned a fair bit, but I’ve "
"actually never seen kurtosis reported in a scientific article to date."

"Illustration of skewness. On the left we have a negatively skewed data "
"set (skewness = -.93), in the middle we have a data set with no skew "
"(well, hardly any: skewness = -.006), and on the right we have a "
"positively skewed data set (skewness = 0.93)."

"Since it’s the more interesting of the two, let’s start by talking about "
"the **skewness**. Skewness is basically a measure of asymmetry and the "
"easiest way to explain it is by drawing some pictures. As :numref:`fig-"
"skewness` illustrates, if the data tend to have a lot of extreme small "
"values (i.e., the lower tail is “longer” than the upper tail) and not so "
"many extremely large values (left panel) then we say that the data are "
"*negatively skewed*. On the other hand, if there are more extremely large"
" values than extremely small ones (right panel) we say that the data are "
"*positively skewed*. That’s the qualitative idea behind skewness. If "
"there are relatively more values that are far greater than the mean, the "
"distribution is positively skewed or right skewed, with a tail stretching"
" to the right. Negative or left skew is the opposite. A symmetric "
"distribution has a skewness of 0. The skewness value for a positively "
"skewed distribution is positive, and a negative value for a negatively "
"skewed distribution."

"Perhaps more helpfully, you can use jamovi to calculate skewness: it’s a "
"check box in the ``Statistics`` options under ``Exploration`` → "
"``Descriptives``. For the ``afl.margins`` variable, the skewness figure "
"is **0.780**. If you divide the skewness estimate by the Std. error for "
"skewness you have an indication of how skewed the data is. Especially in "
"small samples (*N* < 50), one rule of thumb suggests that a value of 2 or"
" less can mean that the data is not very skewed, and a value of over 2 "
"that there is sufficient skew in the data to possibly limit its use in "
"some statistical analyses. Though there is no clear agreement on this "
"interpretation. That said, this does indicate that the AFL winning "
"margins data is somewhat skewed (0.780 / 0.183 = 4.262)."

"Illustration of kurtosis. On the left, we have a “platykurtic” data set "
"(kurtosis = -.95) meaning that the data set is “too flat”. In the middle "

"means that the pointiness of the data is just about right. Finally, on "

"The final measure that is sometimes referred to, though very rarely in "
"practice, is the **kurtosis** of a data set. Put simply, kurtosis is a "
"measure of the “pointiness” of a data set, as illustrated in :numref"
":`fig-kurtosis`. By convention, we say that the “normal curve” (black "
"lines) has zero kurtosis, so the pointiness of a data set is assessed "

"and we say that the data is *leptokurtic*. Only the data in the middle "
