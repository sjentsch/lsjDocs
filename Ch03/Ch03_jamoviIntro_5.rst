Summary
-------

Every book that tries to teach a new statistical software program to novices
has to cover roughly the same topics, and in roughly the same order. Ours is
no exception, and so in the grand tradition of doing it just the same way
everyone else did it, this chapter covered the following topics:

-  :doc:`Ch03_jamoviIntro_1`: We downloaded and installed jamovi, started it
   up, and quit it.  When quitting jamovi, we looked at good practice in terms
   of saving your data set and analyses.
-  :doc:`Ch03_jamoviIntro_2`: We very briefly oriented to the part of jamovi
   where analyses are done and results appear, how to remove analyses, and
   how to copy-and-paste the results output from jamovi to. e.g., a word
   processor. When then introduced add-on modules that are provided by the
   jamovi community, and how they can extend jamovi capabilities. However, a
   more in depth view on analyses was deferred until later chapters in the
   book.
-  :doc:`Ch03_jamoviIntro_3`: We spent more time looking at the spreadsheet
   of jamovi. We considered different variable types, and saw that sometimes
   we need to coerce data from one type to another. When then discussed how
   to compute new variables.
-  :doc:`Ch03_jamoviIntro_4`: Finally, we also saw how to load data files in
   jamovi. Then we figured out how to open more unusal data files, from
   different file types.
 
We still havenâ€™t arrived at anything that resembles data analysis. Maybe the
next chapter will get us a bit closer!
