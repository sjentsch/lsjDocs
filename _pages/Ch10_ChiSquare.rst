Categorical data analysis
=========================

The term “categorical data” is just another name for “nominal scale data”. It’s
nothing that we haven’t already discussed, it’s just that in the context of
data analysis people tend to use the term “categorical data” rather than
“nominal scale data”. I don’t know why. In any case, **categorical data
analysis** refers to a collection of tools that you can use when your data are
nominal scale. Those tools are often called “χ² tests” (pronounced “chi-square”,
sometimes “chi-squared”). They determine whether there is a statistically
significant difference between expected and observed frequencies and whether
the observations follows a χ² frequency distribution. However, there are a lot
of different tools that can be used for categorical data analysis, and this
chapter covers only a few of the more common ones.
