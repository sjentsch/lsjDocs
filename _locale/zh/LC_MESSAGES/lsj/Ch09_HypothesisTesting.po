"*The process of induction is the process of assuming the simplest law "
"that can be made to harmonize with our experience. This process, however,"
" has no logical foundation but only a psychological one. It is clear that"
" there are no grounds for believing that the simplest course of events "
"will really happen. It is an hypothesis that the sun will rise tomorrow: "
"and this means that we do not know whether it will rise.*"

"In the last chapter I discussed the ideas behind estimation, which is one"
" of the two “big ideas” in inferential statistics. It’s now time to turn "
"our attention to the other big idea, which is *hypothesis testing*. In "
"its most abstract form, hypothesis testing is really a very simple idea. "
"The researcher has some theory about the world and wants to determine "
"whether or not the data actually support that theory. However, the "
"details are messy and most people find the theory of hypothesis testing "
"to be the most frustrating part of statistics. The structure of the "
"chapter is as follows. First, I’ll describe how hypothesis testing works "
"in a fair amount of detail, using a simple running example to show you "
"how a hypothesis test is “built”. I’ll try to avoid being too dogmatic "
"while doing so, and focus instead on the underlying logic of the testing "
"procedure.\\ [#]_ Afterwards, I’ll spend a bit of time talking about the "
"various dogmas, rules and heresies that surround the theory of hypothesis"
" testing."

"A technical note. The description below differs subtly from the standard "
"description given in a lot of introductory texts. The orthodox theory of "
"null hypothesis testing emerged from the work of Sir Ronald Fisher and "
"Jerzy Neyman in the early 20th century; but Fisher and Neyman actually "
"had very different views about how it should work. The standard treatment"
" of hypothesis testing that most texts use is a hybrid of the two "
"approaches. The treatment here is a little more Neyman-style than the "
"orthodox view, especially as regards the meaning of the *p* value."
