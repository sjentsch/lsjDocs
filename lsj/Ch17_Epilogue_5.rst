Learning the basics, and learning them in jamovi
------------------------------------------------

Okay, that was a long list. And even that listing is massively
incomplete. There really are a *lot* of big ideas in statistics that I
haven’t covered in this book. It can seem pretty depressing to finish an
almost 500-page textbook only to be told that this is only the
beginning, especially when you start to suspect that half of the stuff
you’ve been taught is wrong. For instance, there are a lot of people in
the field who would strongly argue against the use of the classical
ANOVA model, yet I’ve devoted two whole chapters to it! Standard ANOVA
can be attacked from a Bayesian perspective, or from a robust statistics
perspective, or even from a “it’s just plain wrong” perspective (people
very frequently use ANOVA when they should actually be using mixed
models). So why learn it at all?

As I see it, there are two key arguments. Firstly, there’s the pure
pragmatism argument. Rightly or wrongly, ANOVA is widely used. If you
want to understand the scientific literature, you need to understand
ANOVA. And secondly, there’s the “incremental knowledge” argument. In
the same way that it was handy to have seen one-way ANOVA before trying
to learn factorial ANOVA, understanding ANOVA is helpful for
understanding more advanced tools, because a lot of those tools extend
on or modify the basic ANOVA setup in some way. For instance, although
mixed models are way more useful than ANOVA and regression, I’ve never
heard of anyone learning how mixed models work without first having
worked through ANOVA and regression. You have to learn to crawl before
you can climb a mountain.

Actually, I want to push this point a bit further. One thing that I’ve
done a lot of in this book is talk about fundamentals. I spent a lot of
time on probability theory. I talked about the theory of estimation and
hypothesis tests in more detail than I needed to. Why did I do all this?
Looking back, you might ask whether I really *needed* to spend all that
time talking about what a probability distribution is, or why there was
even a section on probability density. If the goal of the book was to
teach you how to run a t-test or an ANOVA, was all that really necessary?
Was this all just a huge waste of everyone’s time???

The answer, I hope you’ll agree, is no. The goal of an introductory
stats is *not* to teach ANOVA. It’s not to teach t-tests, or regressions,
or histograms, or p-values. The goal is to start you on the path towards
becoming a skilled data analyst. And in order for you to become a skilled
data analyst, you need to be able to do more than ANOVA, more than t-tests,
regressions and histograms. You need to be able to *think properly* about
data. You need to be able to learn the more advanced statistical models
that I talked about in the last section, and to understand the theory upon
which they are based. And you need to have access to software that will let
you use those advanced tools. And this is where, in my opinion at least,
all that extra time I’ve spent on the fundamentals pays off. If you
understand probability theory, you’ll find it much easier to switch from
frequentist analyses to Bayesian ones.

In short, I think that the big payoff for learning statistics this way
is *extensibility*. For a book that only covers the very basics of data
analysis, this book has a massive overhead in terms of learning
probability theory and so on. There’s a whole lot of other things that
it pushes you to learn besides the specific analyses that the book
covers. So if your goal had been to learn how to run an ANOVA in the
minimum possible time, well, this book wasn’t a good choice. But as I
say, I don’t think that is your goal. *I* think you want to learn how to
do data analysis. And if that really is your goal, you want to make sure
that the skills you learn in your introductory stats class are naturally
and cleanly extensible to the more complicated models that you need in
real world data analysis. You want to make sure that you learn to use
the same tools that real data analysts use, so that you can learn to do
what they do. And so yeah, okay, you’re a beginner right now (or you
were when you started this book), but that doesn’t mean you should be
given a dumbed-down story, a story in which I don’t tell you about
probability density, or a story where I don’t tell you about the
nightmare that is factorial ANOVA with unbalanced designs. And it
doesn’t mean that you should be given baby toys instead of proper data
analysis tools. Beginners aren’t dumb, they just lack knowledge. What
you need is *not* to have the complexities of real world data analysis
hidden from from you. What you need are the skills and tools that will
let you handle those complexities when they inevitably ambush you in the
real world.

And what I hope is that this book, or the finished book that this will
one day turn into, is able to help you with that.
