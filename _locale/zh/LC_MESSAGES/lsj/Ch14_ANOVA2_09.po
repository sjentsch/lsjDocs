"`The method of planned comparisons <Ch14_ANOVA2_09.html#the-method-of-"
"planned-comparisons>`__ Following on from the previous sections on "
"contrasts and post-hoc tests in ANOVA, I think the method of planned "
"comparisons is important enough to deserve a quick discussion. In our "
"discussions of multiple comparisons, in the previous section and back in "
"Chapter `Comparing several means (one-way ANOVA) <Ch13_ANOVA.html"
"#comparing-several-means-one-way-anova>`__, I’ve been assuming that the "
"tests you want to run are genuinely post-hoc. For instance, in our drugs "
"example above, maybe you thought that the drugs would all have different "
"effects on mood (i.e., you hypothesised a main effect of drug), but you "
"didn’t have any specific hypothesis about how they would be different, "
"nor did you have any real idea about *which* pairwise comparisons would "
"be worth looking at. If that is the case, then you really have to resort "
"to something like Tukey’s HSD to do your pairwise comparisons."

"The situation is rather different, however, if you genuinely did have "
"real, specific hypotheses about which comparisons are of interest, and "
"you *never* *ever* have any intention to look at any other comparisons "
"besides the ones that you specified ahead of time. When this is true, and"
" if you honestly and rigorously stick to your noble intentions to not run"
" any other comparisons (even when the data look like they’re showing you "
"deliciously significant effects for stuff you didn’t have a hypothesis "
"test for), then it doesn’t really make a lot of sense to run something "
"like Tukey’s HSD, because it makes corrections for a whole bunch of "
"comparisons that you never cared about and never had any intention of "
"looking at. Under those circumstances, you can safely run a (limited) "
"number of hypothesis tests without making an adjustment for multiple "
"testing. This situation is known as the **method of planned "
"comparisons**, and it is sometimes used in clinical trials. However, "
"further consideration is out of scope for this introductory book, but at "
"least you know that this method exists!"
