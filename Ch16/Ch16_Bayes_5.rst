Summary
-------

The first half of this chapter was focused primarily on the theoretical
underpinnings of Bayesian statistics. I introduced the mathematics for how
Bayesian inference works (section :doc:`Ch16_Bayes_1`), and gave a very basic
overview of how :doc:`Ch16_Bayes_2` are typically done. Finally, I devoted some
space to talking about why I think Bayesian methods are worth using (section
:doc:`Ch16_Bayes_3`). Then I gave a practical example, a :doc:`Ch16_Bayes_5`.

If you are interested in learning more about the Bayesian approach, there are
many good books you could look into. :ref:`John Kruschke’s (2015)
<Kruschke_2015>` book *Doing Bayesian Data Analysis* is a pretty good place
to start and is a nice mix of theory and practice. His approach is a little
different to the “Bayes factor” approach that I have discussed here, so you
will not be covering the same ground. If you are a cognitive psychologist, you
might want to check out :ref:`Michael Lee and Eric-Jan Wagenmakers’ (2014)
<Lee_2014>` book *Bayesian Cognitive Modeling*. I picked these two because I
think they are especially useful for people in my discipline, but there is a lot
of good books out there, so look around!
