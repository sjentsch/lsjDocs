Scatterplots
------------

**Scatterplots** are a simple but effective tool for visualising the
relationship between *two* variables, like we saw with the figures in the
section on correlation (Section `Correlations 
<Ch12_Regression_01.html#correlations>`__). It’s this latter application that
we usually have in mind when we use the term “scatterplot”. In this kind of
plot each observation corresponds to one dot. The horizontal location of the
dot plots the value of the observation on one variable, and the vertical
location displays its value on the other variable. In many situations you don’t
really have a clear opinions about what the *causal* relationship is (e.g.,
does A cause B, or does B cause A, or does some other variable C control both
A and B). If that’s the case, it doesn’t really matter which variable you plot
on the x-axis and which one you plot on the y-axis. However, in many situations
you do have a pretty strong idea which variable you think is most likely to be
causal, or at least you have some suspicions in that direction. If so, then
it’s conventional to plot the cause variable on the x-axis, and the effect
variable on the y-axis. With that in mind, let’s look at how to draw
scatterplots in jamovi, using the same ``parenthood`` data set that I used when
introducing correlations.

Suppose my goal is to draw a scatterplot displaying the relationship between
the amount of sleep that I get (``dan.sleep``) and how grumpy I am the next day
(``dan.grump``). There are two different ways in which we can use jamovi to get
the plot that we’re after. The first way is to use the ``Plot`` option under
the ``Regression`` → ``Correlation Matrix`` button, giving us the output shown
in :numref:`fig-scatterplot1`. Note that jamovi draws a line through the
points, we’ll come onto this a bit later in Section `What is a linear regression
model? <Ch12_Regression_03.html#what-is-a-linear-regression-model>`__. Plotting
a scatterplot in this way also allow you to specify ``Densities for variables``
and this option adds a density curve showing how the data in each variable is
distributed.

The second way do to it is to use one of the jamovi add-on modules. This
module is called ``scatr`` and you can install it by clicking on the large
``+`` icon in the top right of the jamovi screen, opening the jamovi
library, scrolling down until you find ``scatr`` and clicking ``Install``.
When you have done this, you will find a new ``Scatterplot`` command
available under the ``Exploration`` button. This plot is a bit different
than the first way, see :numref:`fig-scatterplot2`, but the important
information is the same.

More elaborate options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Often you will want to look at the relationships between several
variables at once, using a **scatterplot matrix** (in jamovi via the
``Correlation Matrix`` - ``Plot`` command). Just add another variable, for
example ``baby.sleep`` to the list of variables to be correlated, and
jamovi will create a scatterplot matrix for you, just like the one in
:numref:`fig-scatterplot3`.
