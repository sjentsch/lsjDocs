"Another alternative to histograms is a **box plot**, sometimes called a "
"“box and whiskers” plot. Like histograms they’re most suited to interval "
"or ratio scale data. The idea behind a box plot is to provide a simple "
"visual depiction of the median, the interquartile range, and the range of"
" the data. And because they do so in a fairly compact way box plots have "
"become a very popular statistical graphic, especially during the "
"exploratory stage of data analysis when you’re trying to understand the "
"data yourself. Let’s have a look at how they work, again using the "
"``afl.margins`` data as our example."

"The easiest way to describe what a box plot looks like is just to draw "
"one. Click on the ``Box plot`` check box and you will get the plot shown "
"on the lower right of :numref:`fig-boxplot1`. jamovi has drawn the most "
"basic box plot possible. When you look at this plot this is how you "
"should interpret it: the thick line in the middle of the box is the "
"median; the box itself spans the range from the 25th percentile to the "
"75th percentile; and the “whiskers” go out to the most extreme data point"
" that doesn’t exceed a certain bound. By default, this value is 1.5 times"
" the interquartile range (IQR), calculated as *25th percentile - (1.5 \\*"
" IQR)* for the lower boundary, and *75th percentile \\+ (1.5 \\* IQR)* "
"for the upper boundary. Any observation whose value falls outside this "
"range is plotted as a circle or dot instead of being covered by the "
"whiskers, and is commonly referred to as an **outlier**. For our AFL "
"margins data there are two observations that fall outside this range, and"
" these observations are plotted as dots (the upper boundary is 107, and "
"looking over the data column in the spreadsheet there are two "
"observations with values higher than this, 108 and 116, so these are the "
"dots)."

"A variation to the traditional box plot is the violin plot. Violin plots "
"are similar to box plots except that they also show the kernel "
"probability density of the data at different values. Typically, violin "
"plots will include a marker for the median of the data and a box "
"indicating the interquartile range, as in standard box plots. In jamovi "
"you can achieve this sort of functionality by checking both the "
"``Violin`` and the ``Box plot`` check boxes. See :numref:`fig-boxplot2`, "
"which also has the ``Data`` check box turned on to show the actual data "
"points on the plot. This does tend to make the graph a bit too busy "
"though, in my opinion. Clarity is simplicity, so in practice it might be "
"better to just use a simple box plot."

"One last thing. What if you want to draw multiple box plots at once? "
"Suppose, for instance, I wanted separate box plots showing the AFL "
"margins not just for 2010 but for every year between 1987 and 2010. To do"
" that the first thing we``ll have to do is find the data. These are "
"stored in the ``aflsmall2.csv`` file. So let’s load it into jamovi and "
"see what is in it. You will see that it is a pretty big data set. It "
"contains 4296 games and the variables that we’re interested in. What we "
"want to do is have jamovi draw box plots for the ``margin`` variable, but"
" plotted separately for each ``year``. The way to do this is to move the "
"``year`` variable across into the ``Split by`` box, as in :numref:`fig-"
"splitfile1`."

"The result is shown in :numref:`fig-boxplot3`. This version of the box "
"plot, split by year, gives a sense of why it’s sometimes useful to choose"
" box plots instead of histograms. It’s possible to get a good sense of "
"what the data look like from year to year without getting overwhelmed "
"with too much detail. Now imagine what would have happened if I’d tried "
"to cram 24 histograms into this space: no chance at all that the reader "
"is going to learn anything useful."

"Because the box plot automatically separates out those observations that "
"lie outside a certain range, depicting them with a dot in jamovi, people "
"often use them as an informal method for detecting **outliers**: "
"observations that are “suspiciously” distant from the rest of the data. "
"Here’s an example. Suppose that I’d drawn the box plot for the AFL "
"margins data and it came up looking like :numref:`fig-boxplot4`."

"It’s pretty clear that something funny is going on with two of the "
"observations. Apparently, there were two games in which the margin was "
"over 300 points! That doesn’t sound right to me. Now that I’ve become "
"suspicious it’s time to look a bit more closely at the data. In jamovi "
"you can quickly find out which of these observations are suspicious and "
"then you can go back to the raw data to see if there has been a mistake "
"in data entry. To do this you need to set up a filter so that only those "
"observations with values over a certain threshold are included. In our "
"example, the threshold is over 300, so that is the filter we will create."
" First, click on the ``Filters`` button at the top of the jamovi window, "
"and then type ``margin > 300`` into the filter field, as in :numref:`fig-"
"filter1`."

"This filter creates a new column in the spreadsheet view where only those"
" observations that pass the filter are included. One neat way to quickly "
"identify which observations these are is to tell jamovi to produce a "
"``Frequency table`` (in the ``Exploration`` → ``Descriptives`` window) "
"for the ``ID`` variable (which must be a nominal variable otherwise the "
"Frequency table is not produced). In :numref:`fig-filter2` you can see "
"that the ID values for the observations where the margin was over 300 are"
" **14** and **134**. These are suspicious cases, or observations, where "
"you should go back to the original data source to find out what is going "
"on."

"Usually you find that someone has just typed in the wrong number. Whilst "
"this might seem like a silly example, I should stress that this kind of "
"thing actually happens a lot. Real world data sets are often riddled with"
" stupid errors, especially when someone had to type something into a "
"computer at some point. In fact, there’s actually a name for this phase "
"of data analysis and in practice it can take up a huge chunk of our time:"
" **data cleaning**. It involves searching for typing mistakes (“typos”), "
"missing data and all sorts of other obnoxious errors in raw data files."

"For less extreme values, even if they are flagged in a a box plot as "
"outliers, the decision about whether to include outliers or exclude them "
"in any analysis depends heavily on *why* you think the data look they way"
" they do and what you want to use the data *for*. You really need to "
"exercise good judgement here. If the outlier looks legitimate to you, "
"then keep it. In any case, I’ll return to the topic again in Section "
