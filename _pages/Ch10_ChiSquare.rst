Now that we’ve covered the basic theory behind hypothesis testing, it’s time to
start looking at specific tests that are commonly used in psychology. So where
should we start? Not every textbook agrees on where to start, but I’m going to
start with “χ² tests” (“Categorical data analysis”, this chapter) and
“*t*-tests” (Chapter :doc:`Comparing two means <Ch11_tTest>`). Both of these
tools are very frequently used in scientific practice, and whilst they’re not
as powerful as “regression” (see Chapter :doc:`Correlation and linear regression
<Ch12_Regression>`) and “Analysis of Variance” (Chapters :doc:`Comparing several
means (one-way ANOVA) <Ch13_ANOVA>` and :doc:`Factorial ANOVA <Ch14_ANOVA2>`)
they’re much easier to understand. Finally, there is :doc:`Factor analysis
<Ch15_FactorAnalysis>` that aims to describe the  variability among observed,
correlated variables in terms of a lower number of unobserved variables called
factors or latent Variables.

The term “categorical data” in the title of this chapter is just another name
for “nominal scale data”. It’s nothing that we haven’t already discussed, it’s
just that in the context of data analysis people tend to use the term
“categorical data” rather than “nominal scale data”. I don’t know why. In any
case, **categorical data analysis** refers to a collection of tools that you
can use when your data are nominal scale. Those tools are often called “χ²
tests” (pronounced “chi-square”, sometimes “chi-squared”). They determine
whether there is a statistically significant difference between expected and
observed frequencies and whether the observations follows a χ² frequency
distribution. However, there are a lot of different tools that can be used for
categorical data analysis, and this chapter covers only a few of the more
common ones.
