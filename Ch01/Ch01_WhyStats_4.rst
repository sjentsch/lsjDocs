Statistics in everyday life
---------------------------

.. epigraph::
   | *“We are drowning in information,*
   | * but we are starved for knowledge”*
   
   -- Various authors, original probably John Naisbitt

When I started writing up my lecture notes I took the 20 most recent news
articles posted to the ABC news website. Of those articles, eight involved a
discussion of something that I would call a statistical topic and six of those
made a mistake. The most common error was failing to report baseline data (e.g.,
the article mentions that 5\% of people in situation X have some characteristic
Y, but does not say how common the characteristic is for everyone else!). The
point I am trying to make here is not that journalists are bad at statistics
(though they almost always are), it is that a basic knowledge of statistics is
very helpful for trying to figure out when someone else is either making a
mistake or even lying to you. In fact, one of the biggest things that a
knowledge of statistics does to you is cause you to get angry at the newspaper
or the internet on a far more frequent basis. You can find a good example of
this in the section :ref:`A real life example <a_real_life_example>`.
