Summary
-------

There’s a fair bit covered in this chapter, but there’s still a lot missing.
Most obviously, I haven’t discussed how to run an ANOVA when you are interested
in more than one grouping variable, but that will be discussed in a lot of
detail in chapter :doc:`Factorial ANOVA <../Ch14/Ch14_ANOVA2>`. In terms of what we
have discussed, the key topics were:

-  The basic logic behind :doc:`how ANOVA works <../Ch13/Ch13_ANOVA_02>` and :doc:`how
   to run one in jamovi <../Ch13/Ch13_ANOVA_03>`.

-  How to compute an :doc:`effect size <../Ch13/Ch13_ANOVA_04>` for an ANOVA.

-  :doc:`Post-hoc analysis and corrections for multiple testing <../Ch13/Ch13_ANOVA_05>`.

-  The :doc:`assumptions made by the ANOVA <../Ch13/Ch13_ANOVA_06>`: How to check the
   homogeneity of variance assumption and what to do if it is violated; as well
   as how to check the normality assumption and what to do if it is violated.

-  :doc:`Repeated measures ANOVA <../Ch13/Ch13_ANOVA_07>` and its non-parametric
   equivalent, the :doc:`Friedman test <../Ch13/Ch13_ANOVA_08>`.

As with all of the chapters in this book, there are quite a few different
sources that I’ve relied upon, but the one stand-out text that I’ve been most
heavily influenced by is `Sahai and Ageel (2000)
<../Other/References.html#sahai-2000>`__. It’s not a good book for beginners, but it’s
an excellent book for more advanced readers who are interested in
understanding the mathematics behind ANOVA.
