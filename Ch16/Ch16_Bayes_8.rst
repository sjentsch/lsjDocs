Summary
-------

The first half of this chapter was focused primarily on the theoretical
underpinnings of Bayesian statistics. I introduced the mathematics for how
Bayesian inference works (section :doc:`Probabilistic reasoning by rational
agents <Ch16_Bayes_1>`), and gave a very basic overview of how :doc:`Bayesian
hypothesis testing <Ch16_Bayes_2>` is typically done. Finally, I devoted some
space to talking about why I think Bayesian methods are worth using (section
:doc:`Why be a Bayesian? <Ch16_Bayes_3>`). Then I gave a practical example,
a :doc:`Bayesian *t*-test <Ch16_Bayes_5>`.

If you’re interested in learning more about the Bayesian approach, there are
many good books you could look into. :ref:`John Kruschke’s (2015)
<Kruschke_2015>` book *Doing Bayesian Data Analysis* is a pretty good place
to start and is a nice mix of theory and practice. His approach is a little
different to the “Bayes factor” approach that I’ve discussed here, so you
won’t be covering the same ground. If you’re a cognitive psychologist, you
might want to check out :ref:`Michael Lee and Eric-Jan Wagenmakers’ (2014)
<Lee_2014>` book *Bayesian Cognitive Modeling*. I picked these two because I
think they’re especially useful for people in my discipline, but there’s a lot
of good books out there, so look around!
