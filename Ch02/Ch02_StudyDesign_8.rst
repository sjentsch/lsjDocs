Summary
-------

This chapter is not really meant to provide a comprehensive discussion of
psychological research methods. It would require another volume just as
long as this one to do justice to the topic. However, in real-life
statistics and study design are so tightly intertwined that it is very
handy to discuss some of the key topics. In this chapter, I have briefly
discussed the following topics:

-  :doc:`Ch02_StudyDesign_1`: What does it mean to operationalise a theoretical
   construct? What does it mean to have variables and take measurements?

-  :doc:`Ch02_StudyDesign_2`: Remember that there are *two* different
   distinctions here. There is the difference between discrete and continuous
   data, and there is the difference between the four different scale types
   (nominal, ordinal, interval and ratio).

-  :doc:`Reliability of a measurement <Ch02_StudyDesign_3>`: If I measure the
   “same” thing twice, should I expect to see the same result? Only if my
   measure is reliable. But what does it mean to talk about doing the “same”
   thing? Well, that is why we have different types of reliability. Make sure
   you remember what they are.

-  :doc:`Terminology: predictors and outcomes <Ch02_StudyDesign_4>`: What
   roles do variables play in an analysis? Can you remember the difference
   between predictors and outcomes? Dependent and independent variables? etc.

-  :doc:`Experimental and non-experimental research designs
   <Ch02_StudyDesign_5>`: What makes an experiment an experiment? Is
   it a nice white lab coat, or does it have something to do with researcher
   control over variables?

-  :doc:`Validity and its threats <Ch02_StudyDesign_6>`: Does your study
   measure what you want it to? How might things go wrong? And is it my
   imagination, or was that a very long list of possible ways in which things
   can go wrong?

All this should make clear to you that study design is a critical part of
research methodology. I built this chapter from the classic little book by
:ref:`Campbell and Stanley (1963) <Campbell_1963>`, but there are of course a
large number of textbooks out there on research design. Spend a few minutes
with your favourite search engine and you will find dozens.
