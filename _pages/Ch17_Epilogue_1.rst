Omissions within the topics covered
-----------------------------------

Even within the topics that I have covered in the book, there are a lot
of omissions that I’d like to redress in future version of the book.
Just sticking to things that are purely about statistics (rather than
things associated with jamovi), the following is a representative but
not exhaustive list of topics that I’d like to expand on at some time:

-  **Other types of correlations.** In Chapter `Correlation and linear
   regression <Ch12_Regression.html#correlation-and-linear-regression>`__ I
   talked about two types of correlation: Pearson and Spearman. Both of these
   methods of assessing correlation are applicable to the case where you have
   two continuous variables and want to assess the relationship between
   them. What about the case where your variables are both nominal
   scale? Or when one is nominal scale and the other is continuous?
   There are actually methods for computing correlations in such cases
   (e.g., polychoric correlation), and it would be good to see these
   included.

-  **More detail on effect sizes.** In general, I think the treatment of
   effect sizes throughout the book is a little more cursory than it
   should be. In almost every instance, I’ve tended just to pick one
   measure of effect size (usually the most popular one) and describe
   that. However, for almost all tests and models there are multiple
   ways of thinking about effect size, and I’d like to go into more
   detail in the future.

-  **Dealing with violated assumptions.** In a number of places in the
   book I’ve talked about some things you can do when you find that the
   assumptions of your test (or model) are violated, but I think that I
   ought to say more about this. In particular, I think it would have
   been nice to talk in a lot more detail about how you can tranform
   variables to fix problems. I talked a bit about this in the sections
   `Transforming or recoding a variable
   <Ch06_DataHandling_3.html#transforming-or-recoding-a-variable>`__ and
   `Mathematical functions and operations
   <Ch06_DataHandling_4.html#a-few-more-mathematical-functions-and-operations>`__,
   but the discussion isn’t detailed enough I think.

-  **Interaction terms for regression.** In Chapter `Factorial ANOVA
   <Ch14_ANOVA2.html#factorial-anova>`__, I talked about the fact that you
   can have interaction terms in an ANOVA, and I also pointed out that
   ANOVA can be interpreted as a kind of linear regression model. Yet,
   when talking about regression in Chapter `Correlation and linear regression
   <Ch12_Regression.html#correlation-and-linear-regression>`__ I made not
   mention of interactions at all. However, there’s nothing stopping you from
   including interaction terms in a regression model. It’s just a little
   more complicated to figure out what an “interaction” actually means
   when you’re talking about the interaction between two continuous
   predictors, and it can be done in more than one way. Even so, I would
   have liked to talk a little about this.

-  **Method of planned comparison.** As I mentioned this in Chapter `Factorial
   ANOVA <Ch14_ANOVA2.html#factorial-anova>`__, it’s not always appropriate to
   be using a post-hoc correction like Tukey’s HSD when doing an ANOVA,
   especially when you had a very clear (and limited) set of comparisons
   that you cared about ahead of time. I would like to talk more about
   this in the future.

-  **Multiple comparison methods.** Even within the context of talking
   about post-hoc tests and multiple comparisons, I would have liked to
   talk about the methods in more detail, and talk about what other
   methods exist besides the few options I mentioned.
