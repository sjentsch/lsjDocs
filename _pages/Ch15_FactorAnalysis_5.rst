Summary
-------

In this chapter on factor analysis and related techniques we have
introduced and demonstrated statistical analyses that assess the pattern
of relationships in a data set. Specifically, we have covered:

-  :doc:`Exploratory Factor Analysis <Ch15_FactorAnalysis_1>`  (EFA). EFA is a
   statistical technique for identifying underlying latent factors in a data
   set. Each observed variable is conceptualised as representing the latent
   factor to some extent, indicated by a factor loading. Researchers also use
   EFA as a way of data reduction, i.e. identifying observed variables than can
   be combined into new factor variables for subsequent analysis.

-  :doc:`Principal Component Analysis <Ch15_FactorAnalysis_2>` (PCA) is a data
   reduction technique which, strictly speaking, does not identify underlying
   latent factors. Instead, PCA simply produces a linear combination of
   observed variables.

-  :doc:`Confirmatory Factor Analysis <Ch15_FactorAnalysis_3>` (CFA). Unlike
   EFA, with CFA you start with an idea - a model - of how the variables in
   your data are related to each other. You then test your model against the
   observed data and assess how good a fit the model is to the data.

-  :doc:`Internal consistency reliability analysis <Ch15_FactorAnalysis_4>`.
   This form of reliability analysis tests how consistently a scale measures a
   measurement (psychological) construct.
