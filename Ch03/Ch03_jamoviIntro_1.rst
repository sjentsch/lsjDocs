Installating and starting jamovi
--------------------------------

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let’s get started. Just as with any piece of software, jamovi needs to be
installed on a “computer”, which is a magical box that does cool things and
delivers free ponies. Or something along those lines; I may be confusing
computers with the iPad marketing campaigns. Anyway, jamovi is freely
distributed online and you can download it from the jamovi homepage, which is:

   `https://www.jamovi.org <https://www.jamovi.org>`__

At the top of the page, under the heading `“Download”
<https://www.jamovi.org/download.html>`__, you’ll see separate links for
Windows users, Mac users, and Linux users. If you follow the relevant link
you’ll see that the online instructions are pretty self-explanatory.\ [#]_

   (removed)
   At the time of writing, the current version of jamovi is 2.6, but they
   usually issue updates every few months, so you’ll probably have a newer
   version.

Whereas this text book was one of the first resources available to support
jamovi, there is now an abundance of them: Have a look under “resources” →
`community resources <https://www.jamovi.org/community.html>`__ on the
jamovi homepage.

The jamovi window
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One way or another, regardless of what operating system you’re using,
it’s time to open jamovi and get started. When first starting jamovi you
will be presented with a user interface which looks something like
:numref:`fig-startjamovi`.

.. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   :alt: jamovi start window
   :name: fig-startjamovi

   jamovi looks like this when you start it.

.. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

To the left is the :doc:`spreadsheet view <Ch03_jamoviIntro_2>`, and to the
right is where the results of your :doc:`statistical analyses
<Ch03_jamoviIntro_3>` appear. Down the middle is a bar separating these two
regions and this can be dragged to the left or the right to change their sizes.

The first time you open jamovi, you may want to change some of the default
settings. These can be accessed from the settings menu (``⋮``, at the top-left
corner). You can for example change there how many decimals you would like to
be displayed in your analyses’ output, the plot and color schemes for your
figures and (since version 2.3 of jamovi) the language of your jamovi user
interface. On most operating systems (OS), the language defaults to the
language you have set for your OS.\ [#]_

To quit jamovi, just close the program the same way you would any other
program. However, what you might want to do before you quit is save your
work! There are two parts to this: saving any changes to the data set, and
saving the analyses that you ran. It is good practice to save any changes
to the data set as a *new* data set. jamovi saves *both* the data and any
analyses you have undertaken within the same jamovi file. From the main
jamovi menu (``☰``) select ``Save as`` and type in a file name for your
``jamovi file (.omv)``. Remember to save the file in a location where you
can find it again later. I usually create a new folder for specific data
sets and analyses. Alternatively, you can ``Export`` your **data** into a
format for other statistics packages (R, SPSS, SAS, Stata) or as CSV-file
that you can open with virtually all programs that you may use for
statistical analyses. You can, in addition, ``Export`` the **output** of
your analyses as PDF, HTML or as LaTeX-document.

   Although jamovi is updated frequently it doesn’t usually make much of
   a difference for the sort of work we’ll do in this book. In fact,
   during the writing of the book I upgraded several times and it didn’t
   make much difference at all to what is in this book.

   Please note that the figures (screenshots, etc.) within this book are
   using the English user interface.
