Summary
-------

Null hypothesis testing is one of the most ubiquitous elements to statistical
theory. The vast majority of scientific papers report the results of some
hypothesis test or another. As a consequence it is almost impossible to get by
in science without having at least a cursory understanding of what a *p*-value
means, making this one of the most important chapters in the book. As usual,
I’ll end the chapter with a quick recap of the key ideas that we’ve talked
about:

-  `Research hypotheses and statistical hypotheses. Null and alternative
   hypotheses. <Ch09_HypothesisTesting_01.html#a-menagerie-of-hypotheses>`__

-  `Type I and Type II errors 
   <Ch09_HypothesisTesting_02.html#two-types-of-errors>`__

-  `Test statistics and sampling distributions
   <Ch09_HypothesisTesting_03.html#test-statistics-and-sampling-distributions>`__

-  `Hypothesis testing as a decision making process
   <Ch09_HypothesisTesting_04.html#making-decisions>`__

-  `p-values as “soft” decisions
   <Ch09_HypothesisTesting_05.html#the-p-value-of-a-test>`__

-  `Writing up the results of a hypothesis test
   <Ch09_HypothesisTesting_06.html#reporting-the-results-of-a-hypothesis-test>`__

-  `Running the hypothesis test in practice
   <Ch09_HypothesisTesting_07.html#running-the-hypothesis-test-in-practice>`__

-  `Effect size and power
   <Ch09_HypothesisTesting_08.html#effect-size-sample-size-and-power>`__

-  `A few issues to consider regarding hypothesis testing
   <Ch09_HypothesisTesting_09.html#some-issues-to-consider>`__

Later in the book, in Chapter `Bayesian statistics
<Ch16_Bayes.html#bayesian-statistics>`__, I’ll revisit the theory of null
hypothesis tests from a Bayesian perspective and introduce a number of new
tools that you can use if you aren’t particularly fond of the orthodox
approach. But for now, though, we’re done with the abstract statistical
theory, and we can start discussing specific data analysis tools.
