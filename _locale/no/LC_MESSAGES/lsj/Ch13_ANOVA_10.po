"There’s a fair bit covered in this chapter, but there’s still a lot "
"missing. Most obviously, I haven’t discussed how to run an ANOVA when you"
" are interested in more than one grouping variable, but that will be "
"discussed in a lot of detail in Chapter `Factorial ANOVA "
"<Ch14_ANOVA2.html#factorial-anova>`__. In terms of what we have "
"discussed, the key topics were:"

"As with all of the chapters in this book, there are quite a few different"
" sources that I’ve relied upon, but the one stand-out text that I’ve been"
" most heavily influenced by is `Sahai and Ageel (2000) "
"<References.html#sahai-2000>`__. It’s not a good book for beginners, but "
"it’s an excellent book for more advanced readers who are interested in "
"understanding the mathematics behind ANOVA."
