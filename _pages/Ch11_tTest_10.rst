Summary
-------

-  A :doc:`one sample t-test <Ch11_tTest_02>` is used to compare a single
   sample mean against a hypothesised value for the population mean.

-  An :doc:`independent samples t-test <Ch11_tTest_03>` is used to compare the
   means of two groups, and tests the null hypothesis that they have the same
   mean. It comes in two forms: the :doc:`Student test <Ch11_tTest_03>` assumes
   that the groups have the same standard deviation, the :doc:`Welch test
   <Ch11_tTest_04>` does not.

-  A :doc:`paired samples t-test <Ch11_tTest_05>` is used when you have two
   scores from each person, and you want to test the null hypothesis that the
   two scores have the same mean. It is equivalent to taking the difference
   between the two scores for each person, and then running a one sample
   *t*-test on the difference scores.

-  :doc:`One-sided tests <Ch11_tTest_06>` are perfectly legitimate as long as
   they are pre-planned.

-  :doc:`Effect size calculations <Ch11_tTest_07>` for the difference between
   means can be calculated via the Cohenâ€™s *d*-statistic.

-  You can check the normality of a sample using QQ plots and the
   :doc:`Shapiro-Wilk test <Ch11_tTest_08>`.

-  If your data are non-normal, you can use :doc:`Mann-Whitney or Wilcoxon
   tests <Ch11_tTest_09>` instead of *t*-tests.
