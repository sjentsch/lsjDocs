"As we discussed earlier in Section `Effect size, sample size and power "
"<Ch09_HypothesisTesting_08.html#effect-size-sample-size-and-power>`__, "
"it’s becoming commonplace to ask researchers to report some measure of "
"effect size. So, let’s suppose that you’ve run your χ²-test, which turns "
"out to be significant. So you now know that there is some association "
"between your variables (independence test) or some deviation from the "
"specified probabilities (goodness-of-fit test). Now you want to report a "
"measure of effect size. That is, given that there is an association or "
"deviation, how strong is it?"

"There are several different measures that you can choose to report, and "
"several different tools that you can use to calculate them. I won’t "
"discuss all of them but will instead focus on the most commonly reported "
"measures of effect size."

"By default, the two measures that people tend to report most frequently "
"are the *ϕ* statistic and the somewhat superior version, known as "
"Cramér’s *V*."

"Mathematically, they’re very simple. To calculate the *ϕ* statistic, you "
"just divide your *X*\\² value by the sample size, and take the square "
"root:"

"The idea here is that the *ϕ* statistic is supposed to range between 0 "
"(no association at all) and 1 (perfect association), but it doesn’t "
"always do this when your contingency table is bigger than 2 · 2, which is"
" a total pain. For bigger tables it’s actually possible to obtain *ϕ* > "
"1, which is pretty unsatisfactory. So, to correct for this, people "
"usually prefer to report the *V* statistic proposed by `Cramer (1946) "
"<References.html#cramer-1946>`__. It’s a pretty simple adjustment to *ϕ*."
" If you’ve got a contingency table with *r* rows and *c* columns, then "
"define *k* = min(*r*, *c*) to be the smaller of the two values. If so, "
"then **Cramér’s V** statistic is:"

"And you’re done. This seems to be a fairly popular measure, presumably "
"because it’s easy to calculate, and it gives answers that aren’t "
"completely silly. With Cramer’s V, you know that the value really does "
"range from 0 (no association at all) to 1 (perfect association)."
