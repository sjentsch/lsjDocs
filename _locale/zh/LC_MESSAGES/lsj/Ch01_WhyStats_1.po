"To the surprise of many students, statistics is a fairly significant part"
" of a psychological education. To the surprise of no-one, statistics is "
"very rarely the *favourite* part of one’s psychological education. After "
"all, if you really loved the idea of doing statistics, you’d probably be "
"enrolled in a statistics class right now, not a psychology class. So, not"
" surprisingly, there’s a pretty large proportion of the student base that"
" isn’t happy about the fact that psychology has so much statistics in it."
" In view of this, I thought that the right place to start might be to "
"answer some of the more common questions that people have about stats."

"A big part of this issue at hand relates to the very idea of statistics. "
"What is it? What’s it there for? And why are scientists so bloody "
"obsessed with it? These are all good questions, when you think about it. "
"So let’s start with the last one. As a group, scientists seem to be "
"bizarrely fixated on running statistical tests on everything. In fact, we"
" use statistics so often that we sometimes forget to explain to people "
"why we do. It’s a kind of article of faith among scientists – and "
"especially social scientists – that your findings can’t be trusted until "
"you’ve done some stats. Undergraduate students might be forgiven for "
"thinking that we’re all completely mad, because no-one takes the time to "
"answer one very simple question:"

"It’s a naive question in some ways, but most good questions are. There’s "
"a lot of good answers to it,\\ [#]_ but for my money, the best answer is "
"a really simple one: we don’t trust ourselves enough. We worry that we’re"
" human, and susceptible to all of the biases, temptations and frailties "
"that humans suffer from. Much of statistics is basically a safeguard. "
"Using “common sense” to evaluate evidence means trusting gut instincts, "
"relying on verbal arguments and on using the raw power of human reason to"
" come up with the right answer. Most scientists don’t think this approach"
" is likely to work."

"In fact, come to think of it, this sounds a lot like a psychological "
"question to me, and since I do work in a psychology department, it seems "
"like a good idea to dig a little deeper here. Is it really plausible to "
"think that this “common sense” approach is very trustworthy? Verbal "
"arguments have to be constructed in language, and all languages have "
"biases – some things are harder to say than others, and not necessarily "
"because they’re false (e.g., quantum electrodynamics is a good theory, "
"but hard to explain in words). The instincts of our “gut” aren’t designed"
" to solve scientific problems, they’re designed to handle day to day "
"inferences – and given that biological evolution is slower than cultural "
"change, we should say that they’re designed to solve the day to day "
"problems for a *different world* than the one we live in. Most "
"fundamentally, reasoning sensibly requires people to engage in "
"“induction”, making wise guesses and going beyond the immediate evidence "
"of the senses to make generalisations about the world. If you think that "
"you can do that without being influenced by various distractors, well, I "
"have a bridge in London I’d like to sell you. Heck, as the next section "
"shows, we can’t even solve “deductive” problems (ones where no guessing "
"is required) without being influenced by our pre-existing biases."
