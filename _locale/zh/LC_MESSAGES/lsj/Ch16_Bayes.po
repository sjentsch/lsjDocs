"The ideas I’ve presented to you in this book describe inferential "
"statistics from the frequentist perspective. I’m not alone in doing this."
" In fact, almost every textbook given to undergraduate psychology "
"students presents the opinions of the frequentist statistician as *the* "
"theory of inferential statistics, the one true way to do things. I have "
"taught this way for practical reasons. The frequentist view of statistics"
" dominated the academic field of statistics for most of the 20th century,"
" and this dominance is even more extreme among applied scientists. It was"
" and is current practice among psychologists to use frequentist methods. "
"Because frequentist methods are ubiquitous in scientific papers, every "
"student of statistics needs to understand those methods, otherwise they "
"will be unable to make sense of what those papers are saying! "
"Unfortunately, in my opinion at least, the current practice in psychology"
" is often misguided and the reliance on frequentist methods is partly to "
"blame. In this chapter I explain why I think this and provide an "
"introduction to Bayesian statistics, an approach that I think is "
"generally superior to the orthodox approach."

"rational agents <Ch16_Bayes_1.html#probabilistic-reasoning-by-rational-"

"covering the basic mathematical rules for how it works as well as an "
"explanation for why I think the Bayesian approach is so useful. "
"Afterwards, I provide a brief overview of how you can do `Bayesian "
"versions of t-tests <Ch16_Bayes_4.html#bayesian-t-tests>`__."
