"The biggest problem with using the Student test in practice is the third "
"assumption listed in the previous section. It assumes that both groups "
"have the same standard deviation. This is rarely true in real life. If "
"two samples don’t have the same means, why should we expect them to have "
"the same standard deviation? There’s really no reason to expect this "
"assumption to be true. We’ll talk a little bit about how you can check "
"this assumption later on because it does crop up in a few different "
"places, not just the *t*-test. But right now I’ll talk about a different "
"form of the *t*-test (`Welch, 1947 <References.html#welch-1947>`__\\ ) "
"that does not rely on this assumption. A graphical illustration of what "
"the **Welch t test** assumes about the data is shown in :numref:`fig-"
"ttesthyp2`, to provide a contrast with the Student test version in "
":numref:`fig-ttesthyp`. I’ll admit it’s a bit odd to talk about the cure "
"before talking about the diagnosis, but as it happens the Welch test can "
"be specified as one of the ‘Independent Samples *t*-Test’ options in "
"jamovi, so this is probably the best place to discuss it."

"The Welch test is very similar to the Student test. For example, the "

"The interpretation of this output should be fairly obvious. You read the "

"Except, except...our result isn’t significant anymore. When we ran the "
"Student test we did get a significant effect, but the Welch test on the "
"same data set is not (*t*\\(23.02) = 2.03, *p* = 0.054). What does this "
"mean? Should we panic? Is the sky burning? Probably not. The fact that "
"one test is significant and the other isn’t doesn’t itself mean very "
"much, especially since I kind of rigged the data so that this would "
"happen. As a general rule, it’s not a good idea to go out of your way to "
"try to interpret or explain the difference between a *p*-value of 0.049 "
"and a *p*-value of 0.051. If this sort of thing happens in real life, the"
" *difference* in these *p*-values is almost certainly due to chance. What"
" does matter is that you take a little bit of care in thinking about what"
" test you use. The Student test and the Welch test have different "
"strengths and weaknesses. If the two populations really do have equal "
"variances, then the Student test is slightly more powerful (lower Type II"
" error rate) than the Welch test. However, if they *don’t* have the same "
"variances, then the assumptions of the Student test are violated and you "
"may not be able to trust it; you might end up with a higher Type I error "
"rate. So it’s a trade off. However, in real life I tend to prefer the "
"Welch test, because almost no-one *actually* believes that the population"
" variances are identical."
