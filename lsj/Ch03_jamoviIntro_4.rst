Summary
-------

Every book that tries to teach a new statistical software program to
novices has to cover roughly the same topics, and in roughly the same
order. Ours is no exception, and so in the grand tradition of doing it
just the same way everyone else did it, this chapter covered the
following topics:

-  `Installing jamovi <Ch03_jamoviIntro_1.html#installing-jamovi>`__:
   We downloaded and installed jamovi, and started it up.

-  `Analyses <Ch03_jamoviIntro_1.html#analyses>`__: We very briefly
   oriented to the part of jamovi where analyses are done and results
   appear, but then deferred this until later in the book.

-  `The spreadsheet <Ch03_jamoviIntro_2.html#the-spreadsheet>`__: We
   spent more time looking at the spreadsheet part of jamovi, and
   considered different variable types, and how to compute new variables.

-  `Loading data in jamovi <Ch03_jamoviIntro_2.html#loading-data-in-jamovi>`__:
   We also saw how to load data files in jamovi, and figured out how to
   open other data files, from different file types.

-  `Changing data from one level to another
   <Ch03_jamoviIntro_3.html#changing-data-from-one-level-to-another>`__:
   sometimes we need to coerce data from one type to another.

-  `Installing add-on modules into jamovi
   <Ch03_jamoviIntro_3.html#installing-add-on-modules-into-jamovi>`__: 
   introduced how to install add-on modules from the jamovi community can
   extend jamovi's capabilities.

-  `Quitting jamovi <Ch03_jamoviIntro_3.html#quitting-jamovi>`__: showed
   good practice in terms of saving your data set and analyses when you
   have finished and are about to quit jamovi.

We still havenâ€™t arrived at anything that resembles data analysis. Maybe
the next Chapter will get us a bit closer!
