.. epigraph::

   *The garden of life never seems to confine itself to the plots
   philosophers have laid out for its convenience. Maybe a few more
   tractors would do the trick.*
     
   -- Roger Zelazny (Home is the Hangman, 1975)
   

This is a somewhat strange chapter, even by my standards. My goal in
this chapter is to talk a bit more honestly about the realities of
working with data than you will see anywhere else in the book. The problem
with real world data sets is that they are *messy*. Very often the data
file that you start out with does not have the variables stored in the
right format for the analysis you want to do. Sometimes there might be a
lot of missing values in your data set. Sometimes you only want to
analyse a subset of the data. Et cetera. In other words, there is a lot
of **data manipulation** that you need to do just to get the variables
in your data set into the format that you need it. The purpose of this
chapter is to provide a basic introduction to these pragmatic topics.
Although the chapter is motivated by the kinds of practical issues that
arise when manipulating real data, I will stick with the practice that
I have adopted through most of the book and rely on very small, toy data
sets that illustrate the underlying issue. Because this chapter is
essentially a collection of techniques and does not tell a single
coherent story, it may be useful to start with a list of topics:

- :doc:`Ch06_DataHandling_1`
  
- :doc:`Ch06_DataHandling_2`

- :doc:`Ch06_DataHandling_3`

- :doc:`Ch06_DataHandling_4`

- :doc:`Ch06_DataHandling_5`

As you can see, the list of topics that the chapter covers is pretty broad, and
there is a *lot* of content there. Even though this is one of the longest and
hardest chapters in the book, I am really only scratching the surface of several
fairly different and important topics. My advice, as usual, is to read through
the chapter once and try to follow as much of it as you can. Do not worry too
much if you can not grasp it all at once, especially the later sections. The rest
of the book is only lightly reliant on this chapter so you can get away with
just understanding the basics. However, what you will probably find is that later
on you will need to flick back to this chapter in order to understand some of the
concepts that I refer to here.
